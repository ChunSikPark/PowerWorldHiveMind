# Method: Writing a timestep simulation

## Abstract

How to drive PowerWorld's TimeStep simulation — turning `.pww` weather files into hourly solar/wind generation CSVs. Covers the prerequisites a case must satisfy per renewable generator (`GenFuelType` containing WND or SUN, valid Lat/Lon, a `TSPFWModelString` PFW model), one pipeline's optional ISO-labelling step, and the `_simulation_worker` function sequence. This is Step 2 of the flagship trail; for the PWW weather files see [pww-data](../concepts/pww-data.md).

> 🔧 **Writing the backend code?** → **[time-step-simulation-backend](../references/time-step-simulation-backend.md)** has the full `_simulation_worker` call sequence, the required `TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyStart/Finish` wrapper, the `_GEN_PARAM` field list, and the key-field rule. That page is the *rebuild-the-code* reference; this page is the *write-it* guide.

## Content

**Step 2 of the flagship trail.** ← prev: [esapp-overview](esapp-overview.md) · next: [pww-data](../concepts/pww-data.md).
Owning project: time step simulation. The concept behind it: [timestep-simulation](../concepts/timestep-simulation.md).

This is the how-to for **writing** a PowerWorld TimeStep simulation — code that drives PowerWorld through SimAuto to turn weather files (`.pww`) into hourly solar/wind generation CSVs. It is *not* a transient-stability study.

> **Library note — prefer `esapp` over `esa`.** Older repos import the standalone `esa` (Easy SimAuto) package. `esapp` (ESA++) is the updated, better-documented version of the same thing — write esapp. Every `RunScriptCommand` / `TimeStep*` script command is identical via `pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(...)`, and the bracket interface (`pw[Type, fields]`, `pw[Type] = df`) replaces esa's `GetParametersMultipleElement` / `change_parameters_multiple_element_df`. See [esapp-overview](esapp-overview.md). (Library choice only — unrelated to the TimeStep-vs-Transient-Stability distinction.)

## 0. Prerequisites

PowerWorld needs, on each renewable generator: a `GenFuelType` that contains `WND`
or `SUN` (the case labels them `WND (Wind)`, `SUN (Solar)`), valid coordinates, and a
PFW model string (`TSPFWModelString` longer than 2 characters). A unit with no PFW model
runs and reads 0 MW for the whole run; attach models with
[grid-workshop-auto-pfw](../concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md). Coordinates: on both public
synthetic cases probed 2026-09-30 the unit's own `Gen.Latitude` read blank and the substation's
`Gen.Latitude:1` / `Longitude:1` (the field export's "Substation Latitude") were set. That
TimeStep then reads the substation pair is not verified in the kit.

## 1. (Optional, one pipeline's convention) Label units with an ISO region

This is **not** a PowerWorld prerequisite. One time-step pipeline writes an ISO region into
`CustomString:2`, a custom field, so its output CSVs can carry an ISO header row; TimeStep does
not read it. Skip this section unless your post-processing needs the label.

`PFW_Insertion/ISO_Insertion_code_shape_file.ipynb` does a geopandas spatial join
of every generator's lat/long against ISO-region shapefiles (nearest-neighbor for
units outside any boundary) and writes the ISO assignment back into the case. This
populates the ISO that later appears as the first metadata header row. Run it once
per case; skip it if the case already has ISO assignments.

> **Resolved:** `PFW_Insertion` (`ISO_Insertion_code_shape_file.ipynb`) writes
> **only `CustomString:2`** (the ISO region via geopandas spatial join). It does
> **not** touch `TSPFWModelString`. PFW model strings must already be in the case;
> [grid-workshop-auto-pfw](../concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md) attaches them, and the
> case-auditor's `timestep` profile counts which units still lack one.

## 2. What your code does (`_simulation_worker`)

`_simulation_worker(case, pww_list, result_csv)` is the core function to implement:
1. Copies the case to a temp `.pwb`, opens it with `PowerWorld(tmp_case)` from esapp.
2. Pulls generator metadata (`GetParametersMultipleElement('gen', ...)` / `pw[Gen, fields]`).
3. Loads weather: `TimeStepLoadPWW("...","Weather Only")` then
   `TimeStepAppendPWW(...)` for any additional files.
4. Selects renewables (`GenFuelType` contains `WND|SUN`) and marks them
   `TimeDomainSelected`.
5. Picks the saved fields:
   `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet(GEN, [BGGenMWFuelTypeGeneric:10, BGGenMWFuelTypeGeneric:12], SELECTED)`.
6. Runs `TimeStepDoRun()` and exports via `TimeStepSaveResultsByTypeCSV(gen, ...)`.

> The simulation is **generator-level** by construction — `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet`
> targets `GEN`. Area/substation-level output is a noted future extension.

## 3. Inputs and outputs

- **In:** one case + one or more `.pww` weather files ([pww-data](../concepts/pww-data.md)).
- **Out:** per run, two CSVs (solar + wind). Historical quarter files grouped by
  year are named `Historical_{year}_solar.csv` / `_wind.csv`; a forecast file is
  named after its stem. Resume-safe: a run is skipped if both its CSVs already
  exist (delete them to re-run).
