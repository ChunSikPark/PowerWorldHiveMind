# Method: Preflight — is PowerWorld actually usable here?

## Abstract

Run this before writing any analysis code. It takes about five seconds and answers the
only question that matters at the start of a session: can this machine drive PowerWorld
from Python at all? Five checks, each with the exact error you get when it fails and
what that error actually means. Skipping this is why an agent writes two hundred lines
of a study and then discovers on the last line that SimAuto was never licensed.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [esapp-overview](esapp-overview.md) · [powerworld-simauto](../concepts/powerworld-simauto.md) · [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md)
- **Next:** [esapp-overview](esapp-overview.md) once every check passes

## Content

> **Agents: run this first.** Do not write analysis code before the preflight passes.
> A failure here is not a bug in your code — it is a fact about the machine, and no
> amount of rewriting the analysis will fix it. Report which check failed and stop.

### The preflight script

Paste this and run it. It prints a line per check and stops at the first failure.

```python
"""PowerWorld preflight. Run before writing any analysis code."""

import sys
from pathlib import Path

CASE = r"C:\path\to\your_case.pwb"   # <- change this


def preflight(case_path: str) -> bool:

    if not sys.platform.startswith("win"):
        print(f"FAIL 1/5  platform is {sys.platform!r}, SimAuto requires Windows")
        return False
    print("ok   1/5  platform is Windows")

### What each failure actually means

| Error you see | What is wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `platform is 'linux'` / `'darwin'` | SimAuto is a Windows COM server. There is no port | Use Windows. The weather half of this kit still works — see [teamoverbyeweather-client](teamoverbyeweather-client.md) |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'win32com'` | pywin32 is not installed | `pip install pywin32` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'esapp'` | esapp is not installed, or you are in the wrong interpreter | `pip install esapp`, and check `sys.executable` is the interpreter you think it is |
| `com_error: (-2147221005, 'Invalid class string', ...)` | SimAuto is not registered. Usually PowerWorld Simulator is not installed at all | Install Simulator. If it *is* installed, run it once as administrator so it registers its COM server |
| `com_error: (-2147221164, 'Class not registered', ...)` | Same as above, or a 32/64-bit mismatch between Python and Simulator | Match the bitness. A 32-bit Simulator will not serve a 64-bit Python |
| A COM error mentioning **licence**, **not authorized**, or **add-on** | Simulator is installed and licensed, but the **SimAuto add-on is a separate licence** and yours does not include it | This cannot be fixed in code. Talk to whoever administers your PowerWorld licence |
| SimAuto starts but a feature errors | Possibly a version difference | Check the build date against [version-requirements](../concepts/version-requirements.md) before assuming a page is wrong |
| `PowerWorldPrerequisiteError` | **Not** a version or licence problem — the case lacks a prerequisite state | e.g. clearing TimeStep results that do not exist yet. Do the prerequisite step first |
| `case not found` | Path typo, or a relative path resolving somewhere unexpected | Use an absolute path. Always |
| Case opens but `n_bus` is 0 | The file opened but is not a valid case | Confirm the `.pwb` is not corrupt; try opening it in Simulator directly |

### The licence check, specifically

This is the check people forget, so it gets its own note.

**PowerWorld Simulator and the SimAuto add-on are licensed separately.** A machine can
have a fully valid, fully working Simulator installation and still be unable to run a
single line of this kit, because automation is a different SKU. Simulator's own GUI will
give you no hint of this — it works fine.

The symptom is that check 4 fails while Simulator itself launches normally. If you can
open your case by double-clicking it but `Dispatch("pwrworld.SimulatorAuto")` raises,
that is the licence, not your code.

### Record the version before you analyse anything

Check 4 prints the Simulator build date. Put it in your report. Field availability and
script-action behaviour both shift between releases, and they shift silently, so when a
result later looks wrong the build date is the first thing worth checking.

`RequestBuildDate` is a Delphi serial date (days since 1899-12-30), not a version number.
For the full version string and what this kit was verified against, see
[version-requirements](../concepts/version-requirements.md).

### Quick version

If you only want the one-line answer:

```python
import win32com.client
win32com.client.Dispatch("pwrworld.SimulatorAuto")   # raises if PowerWorld automation is unavailable
```

If that line runs without raising, everything downstream in this kit is available to
you. If it raises, nothing is, and no rewrite of the analysis will change that.

### What preflight does not tell you

It confirms you can *drive* PowerWorld. It says nothing about whether the case is
suitable for the study you have in mind — whether it solves, whether it has the
generators or weather models you need, whether its limits are configured. Those are
questions for the analysis itself, starting at [esapp-overview](esapp-overview.md).
