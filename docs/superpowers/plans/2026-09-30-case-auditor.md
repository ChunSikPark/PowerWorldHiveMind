# Case-auditor (Plan 2 of 4) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship the kit's second agent — a read-only case auditor that says, with evidence, whether a PowerWorld case is sane and READY for a base power flow, an N-1 (its monitoring), a time step and an OPF, opens every answer with a case summary the engine computed, and names every blocker by its object keys — plus the four rule pages and the three 0b page fixes it cites.

**Architecture:** Pure rule functions over a `CaseData` (named pandas DataFrames plus scalars) that never import esapp, so every rule is unit-tested on hand-built frames with no PowerWorld. One thin esapp reader opens the case, runs **one** AC solve in memory, reads only the fields the rules need, and closes with `esa.exit()` in a `finally`. A CLI, `audit.py --case <pwb> [--profiles base,timestep,opf] [--pww <file>] [--out <dir>]`, writes `findings.json` and `findings.md` (verdicts, `case_summary`, findings, the read-only proof) into `./case-audit/<case name>/` by default. The shipped CLI has no snapshot flags: storing what was read and replaying it are developer tools in `tools/case-audit-dev/`, outside `skills/`, and a replay stamps its output as one. Tests run the real reader against a stand-in esapp that serves a stored public-case snapshot. A skill (`skills/case-audit/SKILL.md`) carries the procedure; the agent (`agents/case-auditor.md`, moved from its draft in the last task) is the role contract.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+ (dry run on 3.13.14), pandas, numpy, esapp 0.2.1 (the reader only), pytest. `claude plugin eval` for the agent evals.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-28-power-system-agents-design.md` (§4 case-auditor, §10 auditor test rows, §11 steps 0b and 2). **Agent brief:** `docs/agents/case-auditor.md` — the engine produces exactly what that file says the agent receives, and Task 17 lists every edit the brief needs.

**Revision 3 (2026-09-30)** — revision 2 came after a serial architect → critic review (both REVISE); revision 3 fixes the eight defects a critic's re-check found in revision 2. What changed and why is in the revision record at the end. Every code block below was run from a **fresh** scratch clone of the kit before it was written here: **case-audit suite 166 passed, 1 skipped** (the live test, which passed separately against Hawaii40 with `PWHM_LIVE_CASE` set); whole kit `python -m pytest skills -q -p no:cacheprovider` **211 passed, 1 skipped**. The probe (Task 1), one OPF per case, and the engine were run live on the two public cases; every PowerWorld instance was closed and both case files were byte-identical afterwards.

**Decisions this plan follows (made before it was written):**

| # | decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Pure rules over `CaseData`, one esapp reader, a CLI writing `findings.json` + `findings.md`; summary numbers computed by the engine, never the agent |
| D2 | Read-only proof: sha256 of the case file before and after, in `findings.json`; an AST test fails the build if the engine names SaveCase, LoadAux, ChangeParameters*, SetData, WriteAuxFile, Delete, or any `RunScriptCommand` (the mirror of the `tests/test_no_save_case.py` idea from a sibling research repo — described, not imported). Revision 2 adds an allowlist over every esapp-bound name in `reader.py` and a test that only `reader.py` imports esapp (R7) |
| D3 | `base.ac_converges` = `SolvePowerFlow` did not raise **and** max bus mismatch ≤ `Sim_Solution_Options.ConvergenceTol:2` (MVA). Never `vmap.solve()`; no retry, no flat start, no DC |
| D4 | A live probe (Task 1) resolves every UNVERIFIED item first; the rules are written against what it observed |
| D5 | Unsourced numbers are named constants in `engine/thresholds.py`, each commented "proposed default, <why>", and listed in the rule pages. `base.gen_over_nameplate` stops past max(1 % of `GenMWMax`, 5 MW), Worth a look above 0.1 MW |
| D6 | `base.ltc_middle_target` is ONE aggregated finding (count + most common band); the full list is in `findings.md` |
| D7 | Three-winding LTCs are out of scope for v1; the rule page and the finding text say so |
| D8 | Not in scope, listed as open questions: a band copied from the tap range, the structure-only stub FYI, `Gen.GenRegNum` pointing at nothing, an `n1` coverage profile |
| D9 | 0b items owned here: reword the ISO / `CustomString:2` lines of `methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md` and replace its "pfw copperplate" reference with the Auto_PFW handoff; port `grid-workshop-auto-pfw` (scrubbed); fix the `XFAuto` gloss in `methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md` |
| D10 | `ts.pww_footprint` reads the `.pww` header per `concepts/pww-data.md` with a small reader in the kit; no file given → one FYI |
| D11 | Evals on pre-computed `findings.*` from the real engine on the public cases, regex graders plus one `llm` grader, and a `tool_used` grader on `Agent` |
| D12 | The last task moves the agent into `agents/`, registers it, updates `docs/agents/README.md`, re-checks discovery, rebuilds `dist/`, and lists every change to the agent text |

**Rulings for revision 2** (from the review coordinator; the plan follows them):

| # | ruling |
|---|---|
| R1 | The shipped `audit.py` has no snapshot flags. `snapshot.py`, `replay.py`, `make_fixture.py`, `scrub_findings.py` and `probe.py` live in `tools/case-audit-dev/`. A replay is stamped `"source": "snapshot"`, `read_only.unchanged: null`, and findings.md's first line reads "Replayed from a stored snapshot; no case was opened". Seeded fixtures come from replays; real ones from live runs, path-scrubbed. CLI tests drive the real `--case` path through a stand-in esapp |
| R2 | Default `--out` is `./case-audit/<stem>/` under the working folder, holding a `.gitignore` of `*`; the path is printed once. Variants are found with `Path.exists()` on computed names; the folder is never listed |
| R3 | The super-area question is settled live (Task 1): an OPF solved on both public cases as they opened, including Texas2k's super area on OPF with every area Off AGC, and Hawaii40's area on OPF inside an Off-AGC super area. A super area on OPF makes its members OPF areas; condition 3 is judged per OPF area |
| R4 | Priced = `GenCostModel` ≠ None **and** `GenCostCurvePoints > 0`. `GenMCost = 0` with a curve is no finding on a renewable, and Worth a look / Probably on purpose on a thermal unit |
| R5 | Evals: no `Skill` in `allowed_tools`; the dispatch grader pins `"subagent_type"`; fixture paths in the prompt body; seeded judgment cases with `not_contains` graders and a line-count regex; the inferred parts named |
| R6 | A failed open stops only the `pwrworld.exe` processes that are new since it began (a helper, tested with a fake process lister) |
| R7 | The AST guard: an allowlist over esapp-bound names, bound-name tracking, the existing substring scan, and `test_only_reader_imports_esapp` |

**Plans 3–4** (study-runner, network-visualizer) are written after this plan ships.

## Global Constraints

- Everything ships inside the kit and is self-contained: no imports from any private research repository.
- Never `cd` in a compound shell command; run every command from the kit root, with absolute paths for anything outside it.
- Commit messages carry no AI attribution lines. `git add` is always path-scoped, never `-A`.
- The kit is public: no case-specific data. The two public synthetic cases may be named with their numbers. **Never** read, list or scan the machine's CEII folders; point tools only at the two public cases below.
- The engine never writes a case (Task 5's AST test). The dev probe (Task 1) is the only code that edits a case, in memory, and it lives in `tools/case-audit-dev/`, outside `skills/`, so no agent is pointed at it.
- A snapshot holds every field the engine reads for every object of a case. Take one only of the two public cases, and commit one only after `make_fixture.py`.
- Every PowerWorld instance is closed with `esa.exit()` in a `finally`.
- Run pytest with `-p no:cacheprovider`. Test file names start `test_audit_` so they never collide with the schema-lookup suite when both run in one session (pytest imports test modules by basename).
- The public cases are not in the kit. Set three variables to your local copies before Tasks 1, 5 and 16 (all public synthetic grids):

```bash
export HAWAII40=/abs/path/to/Hawaii40_base.pwb                                   # 37 buses
export HAWAII40_PWW=/abs/path/to/Hawaii_KonaDay_SYNTHETIC.pww                   # its 3-day weather file
export TEXAS2K=/abs/path/to/Texas2k_series25_case1_summerpeak_PFW.pwb            # 2,751 buses, PFW models attached
```

- **Do not push.** The parent session reviews and pushes.

## Review Focus

1. **An object with zero rows.** `GetParametersMultipleElement` returns `None`, not an empty frame (confirmed live: `3WXFormer` on both public cases). A case with no shunts, loads or contingencies must audit, not crash. → Task 4 `test_none_frame_becomes_empty_frame_with_columns`; Task 5 `test_reads_every_object_and_exits` (Gen reads `None`); Task 6 `test_summary_of_a_case_with_no_shunts_or_loads`.
2. **A case that will not converge.** esapp raises `PowerWorldError` (probed: "Exceeded maximum number…", "Power flow unable to converge"), so the raise decides; the mismatch is a second check, applied only when both it and the tolerance were read. Expect NOT READY everywhere, one solve only, every solve-dependent rule listed as not checked, and the summary marked as unsolved. → Task 4 `test_converged_needs_no_raise_and_mismatch_under_tolerance`, `test_an_unreadable_tolerance_does_not_fail_the_case`; Task 5 `test_a_solve_that_raises_is_recorded_not_retried`; Task 7 `test_raised_solve_stops_every_study`; Task 13 `test_unsolved_case_is_not_ready_and_says_what_was_not_checked`.
3. **`LineCircuit` is text.** PowerWorld pads it (`" 1 "`), and circuits like `01` or `W2` exist; casting to int loses or breaks keys, and a finding without exact keys cannot be acted on. → Task 4 `test_line_circuit_stays_text`; Task 8 `test_ltc_pointing_at_a_disconnected_bus`.
4. **A huge case.** The reader reads only `casedata.READS` (Texas2k: open, solve, read and close in about 12 s; the branch read is ~1 s for 5,344 rows × 41 fields); the bridge search is iterative with integer subtree sizes, and a far side is only built, capped, for the few bridges the stub rule asks about; the weather reader stops at the station list. → Task 9 `test_long_chain_is_linear_in_time_and_memory` (20,000-bus chain, peak memory under 200 MB); Task 11 `test_the_public_hawaii_weather_file_header`.
5. **The auditor run from outside the kit, on a cp1252 console, into a folder with a non-ASCII name.** Under a plugin install the cwd is the user's project; Windows consoles default to cp1252; the output must not land in a git tree unignored. → Task 14 `test_runs_from_outside_the_kit`, `test_survives_a_cp1252_console_with_a_non_ascii_folder` (fails without the console fix, checked), `test_default_out_is_under_the_working_folder_and_ignored`; Task 13 `test_files_are_utf8_whatever_the_names`.

## What the probe found (Task 1, run 2026-09-30)

These are the observations every later task is written against. Rows marked **changed a rule** altered the detection spec.

| question | observed on Hawaii40 and Texas2k | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Does a non-converged AC solve raise? | Yes: `PowerWorldError` "NR PowerFlow - Power flow unable to converge" (load ×12 on Hawaii40) and "…Exceeded maximum number…" (load ×4 on Texas2k). At load ×8 Hawaii40 still "converged" to a 0.18 pu minimum voltage | the raise is the deciding signal; mismatch is the second check (D3); convergence is not sanity |
| `GetParametersMultipleElement` on zero rows | `None` (`3WXFormer`) | `typed()` turns `None` into an empty frame with its columns |
| `XFRegBus = 0` / `SSRegNum = 0` | a SimAuto write of 0 is **silently refused** (previous value stays); a write of another bus takes; own-bus shunts read their own bus number (1 of 1, 202 of 202) | **changed a rule:** 0 is never "own bus"; `reason = "zero"` is a defect |
| `Shunt.AutoControl` | `YES` on every regulating shunt | used as written |
| `Bus.BusIsStarBus` | `NO` on every bus; `3WXFormer` 0 rows on both | whether 3-winding legs appear in `Branch` stays untested (D7) |
| `XFRegTargetType` values | `Middle` on all 12 / 1,351 transformers; no active LTC on either case (all `Fixed`, `XFAuto = NO`) | LTC rules tested on hand-built cases only |
| `Bus.BusVoltLimLow/High` | limit group 0.9 / 1.1 on every bus, read back `0.89999998` / `1.10000002`; an in-memory override 0.95 / 1.04 read back `0.94999999` / `1.03999996` | effective limits; the 0.94 / 1.05 fallback applies only to 0 or blank |
| System MVA base | `Sim_Solution_Options.SBase = 100` on both | the stub charging estimate reads `SBase` per case |
| `ConvergenceTol:2` (MVA) | 1e-5 on Hawaii40, 0.1 on Texas2k | the tolerance is read per case |
| `Gen.Latitude` / `Gen.Latitude:1` | bus pair **blank on every unit** (9 / 400 renewables); the substation pair ("Substation Latitude" in the export) set on all | **changed a rule:** `ts.latlon_missing` accepts either pair; which one TimeStep reads is not verified in the kit |
| `Branch.LineLength` | 0 on every branch | **changed a rule:** `base.dc_skeleton` cannot count zero-length branches; it uses median X/R > 1000 or ≥ 90 % of closed lines with R ≤ 1e-6 and B = 0 |
| `Gen.CustomInteger:1` | blank (`None`) on every unit | Auto_PFW would skip every unclassified wind unit on these cases |
| `SuperArea.BGAGC`, `Area.SAName` | Hawaii40: area 1 `OPF` inside super area `FullCase` = `Off AGC`. Texas2k: super area `Texas` = `OPF`, all 8 member areas `Off AGC` | membership is `Area.SAName` |
| One OPF as the case opened (`InitializePrimalLP`, `SolvePrimalLP`) | **ran** on both: *Successful Solution*, cost 4,206 (Hawaii40) and 260,127 (Texas2k) | **changed a rule:** a super area on OPF meets condition 1 and makes its members OPF areas; an Off-AGC super area does not override a member on OPF. Texas2k's `opf` is READY |
| The same OPF with every area and super area `Off AGC` (in memory) | **did not raise**; `LPOPFSolutionStatus = "Error = No area/superarea constraints set"`, cost 0 | a refused OPF is a status string, not an exception; recorded in `concepts/opf-preconditions.md` (Task 3) |
| `GenMCost` on units with a curve | 0 on Hawaii40's wind and solar (5 curve points each), and the OPF above ran with them movable | **changed a rule:** priced = cost model and curve points; a zero price is not missing data (R4) |
| `ViolationCTG` rows as opened | 14 (Hawaii40), 173 (Texas2k) | `base.stale_ctg_results` fires on both public cases |
| esapp `Scale(LOAD, FACTOR, [4], SYSTEM)` | system load **unchanged** on both (silent no-op) | the probe scales load by writing `LoadMW`/`LoadMVR`; no kit page covers this |

### Task 1: Probe the public cases

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/case-audit-dev/probe.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: esapp; `$HAWAII40`, `$TEXAS2K`.
- Produces: the observation table above; nothing the engine imports.

This task has no unit test: its output is evidence. The probe solves one OPF as the case opened, then edits area and super-area OPF control, one shunt, one transformer, one bus and the loads **in memory** to answer five questions; it never saves, and exits non-zero if a case file's sha256 changes. It lives outside `skills/` so no agent is pointed at a tool that edits cases.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the probe**

`tools/case-audit-dev/probe.py`:

```python
"""Live probe for the case-auditor: what the fields the rules depend on actually read.

    python tools/case-audit-dev/probe.py <case.pwb> [<case.pwb> ...]

Developer tool, kept outside skills/ so no agent runs it: it edits cases in memory. Opens each
case, prints one line per question, and closes it with esa.exit(). One OPF is solved as the case
opened. Five questions need an in-memory edit (area and super-area OPF control switched off; a
value written to one shunt, one transformer and one bus; load scaled until the AC solve fails).
Nothing is ever saved: the case file's sha256 is printed before and after, and the run fails
if they differ.

### Task 2: The four rule pages

**Files:**
- Create: `methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md`
- Create: `concepts/unloaded-ehv-stub-overvoltage.md`
- Modify: `index.md` (two rows)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the probe's observations.
- Produces: the pages `base.regulates_nothing`, `base.ltc_middle_target`, `base.ltc_regulates_lv_side` and `base.floating_stub` cite (Task 15 `test_every_page_a_finding_cites_exists` checks they exist).

Both pages were ported from the author's research notes and scrubbed (no case names, utilities, buses or fingerprinting counts; measurements cited by date and kind; real-model specifics — tie lengths, reactor sizes, step counts, a unit's MVA — rounded to their order of magnitude). The probe results are already folded in.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm neither page exists**

Run: `ls methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md concepts/unloaded-ehv-stub-overvoltage.md`
Expected: `No such file or directory` for both.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md`**

# Checking what each LTC and switched shunt actually regulates

## Abstract

A case can carry a full fleet of live load tap changers (LTCs) and still control voltage badly,
because what decides the outcome is not whether the LTCs are switched on but **which bus each
one holds and how it drives toward its band**. Three defects are common, and each one leaves
the power flow converging with no warning. (1) **A regulator pointed at nothing.** The regulated
bus (`Branch.XFRegBus` for an LTC, `Shunt.SSRegNum` for a switched shunt) does not exist or is
disconnected. (2) **`XFRegTargetType = Middle`**, the shipped value. When the regulated bus
leaves `[XFRegMin, XFRegMax]`, the LTC drives it back to the band's midpoint, not to the nearest
edge. A symmetric band then either lifts healthy buses or overshoots, and no band tuning fixes
both. `Max/Min` does. (3) **An LTC holding its low-voltage side while its high-voltage side is
out of band.** A tap is a ratio, not a source. Holding the LV bus moves the reactive deficit or
surplus onto the HV bus, so the LTC can cause the violation next to it. On a regional planning
model, measured 2026-09-14, re-pointing the regulated bus and switching the target type cleared
both emergency overvoltages and most normal-limit overvoltages. It added no devices.

### First, find out whether the fleet is live

Read these before drawing any conclusion about an LTC:

| field | what it tells you |
|---|---|
| `Branch.LineXfmr` | `YES` if the branch is a transformer |
| `Branch.LineXFType` | `Fixed`, `LTC`, `Mvar` or `Phase`. Only `LTC` regulates voltage |
| `Branch.XFAuto` | `YES`, `NO` or `OPF`: whether automatic control is on for this unit |
| `Branch.XFRegBus` | the bus it regulates. `0` on a fixed transformer |
| `Branch.XFRegMin` / `XFRegMax` | the voltage band, in per unit on the regulated bus |
| `Branch.XFRegTargetType` | `Middle` or `Max/Min` (below) |
| `Sim_Solution_Options.ChkTaps` | `YES` lets the solver move taps at all |

Three reading traps:

- **A band copied from the tap range never acts.** Some synthetic cases ship
  `XFRegMin`/`XFRegMax` = 0.51/1.5, the same numbers as `XFTapMin`/`XFTapMax`. Synth2k_series2
  does this on every transformer, alongside `XFAuto = NO` and `XFRegBus = 0`, so no unit there
  regulates anything (see [converting-lines-to-transformers](converting-lines-to-transformers.md)).
  Read as a voltage band, 0.51–1.5 is ±49 %. The regulated bus is always inside it and the tap
  never moves, yet the unit still reports as regulating.
- **Read the unsuffixed band.** `XFRegMin:1` / `XFRegMax:1` are the Time Step Simulation
  secondary regulation limits, not the power-flow band. On one case family the old 0.51/1.5
  values moved there when the power-flow band was set properly. A search for those numbers
  still finds them and suggests the wrong diagnosis.
- **`XFFixedTap` is not the live ratio.** It is the fixed component and can read `1.0` on every
  auto transformer, which looks like a fleet that has never moved. The live ratio is
  `Branch.LineTap`. It tracks `1 + XFTapPos × XFStep` exactly: `XFTapPos = -1` with
  `XFStep = 0.00625` reads `LineTap = 0.99375`.

### The rule that decides every tap question

A tap changes the turns ratio. It creates no reactive power. Raising the LV bus pulls the same
Mvar through the transformer from the HV side, so the HV bus goes down, and lowering the LV bus
pushes the HV bus up. **A tap moves a deficit or a surplus; it does not fill or absorb it.** It
fixes a violation only where the other side has headroom.

To find which side is the source, look at which side is higher in the solved case, not which
one has the higher nominal kV. A large load at 138 kV fed from a 69 kV network can sit below the
69 kV bus feeding it.

### Defect 1: the regulator points at nothing

An LTC's `XFRegBus`, or a switched shunt's `SSRegNum`, names a bus number. If that number is not
a bus in the case, or the bus reads `Bus.BusStatus = Disconnected`, the device has no valid
target. The case still solves, and the device either sits idle or does something PowerWorld
chose for it. Neither is what the modeller intended.

A switched shunt whose nominal range is zero (`SSMaxMVR = SSMinMVR = 0`) and whose regulated bus
is empty is usually a placeholder, not a defect.

**What `0` means.** Probed 2026-09-30 on two public synthetic cases (Hawaii40, Texas2k): writing
`XFRegBus = 0` on an LTC, or `SSRegNum = 0` on a regulating shunt, through SimAuto is **silently
refused** - the call succeeds and the previous bus number stays. A write to another existing bus
number does take. And a shunt that regulates its own terminal reads its own bus number: every
regulating shunt on both cases did (1 of 1 and 202 of 202). So `0` is never PowerWorld's spelling
of "own bus". A `0` read back on an active regulator came in with the case file, and it names no
target. `Shunt.AutoControl` read `YES` on every regulating shunt of both cases.

### Defect 2: `XFRegTargetType = Middle`

The field takes exactly two values. Measured on a live case:

| written | reads back |
|---|---|
| `Middle` | `Middle` |
| `Max`, `Maximum`, `High` | `Max/Min` |
| `Value`, `Specified`, `Target`, `Min` | coerced to `Middle` |

While the regulated bus is inside `[XFRegMin, XFRegMax]`, the LTC does nothing. When the bus
leaves the band:

- **`Middle`** drives it to the **midpoint** of the band.
- **`Max/Min`** drives it to the **nearest edge** and stops. A wide band becomes a one-sided
  limit: above `XFRegMax` the LTC taps down to `XFRegMax`, and anywhere inside the band it
  leaves the bus alone.

`XFRegTargetValue` is derived and read-only. Writing 1.04 to it read back 1.014, which was the
midpoint of the band in force at the time. That read-back is what confirmed the mechanism.

**Why a symmetric band cannot be tuned into working.** Measured 2026-09-14 on a regional
planning model: the same few tens of LTCs were retuned across five dispatches, four ways. Each
attempt was scored by the violations it *created*.

| attempt | band (pu) | target type | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1.030 – 1.045 | `Middle` | created many new violations |
| 2 | 1.035 – 1.048 | `Middle` | the 1.035 floor lifted healthy buses; one went from just under 1.03 to just over 1.05 |
| 3 | 0.98 – 1.048 | `Middle` | midpoint 1.014 overshot downward and dumped reactive power into neighbouring buses |
| 4 | **0.98 – 1.045** | **`Max/Min`** | one new violation; worked |

Attempts 2 and 3 fail in opposite directions for the same reason. A band low enough not to lift
a healthy bus has a midpoint well below the criterion. A band whose midpoint sits near the
criterion has a floor that lifts healthy buses. `Max/Min` removes the conflict: the floor can
stay at a harmless 0.98, and the LTC only ever acts downward.

Leave margin under the criterion. With a 1.05 criterion, 1.045 is safer than 1.050. A case
tuned to sit at exactly 1.050 in one dispatch violates in every other dispatch on the same base.

### Defect 3: the LTC holds its low-voltage side

If `XFRegBus` is the transformer's LV terminal, the LTC keeps a healthy 138 kV bus inside a
tight band while the HV bus it does not regulate drifts. The tap then works against the HV side.

The worst case measured (2026-09-14, regional planning model): an EHV bus at about **1.13 pu**,
past the 1.10 emergency limit. It had no generator, no shunt and no load, just two branches. The
transformer beside it held its LV bus just above the top of a narrow band (`XFRegError` a few
thousandths of a pu). Its tap was at `XFTapMax`, more than a dozen steps up, and the transformer
carried only a few MVA.
That LTC was the only device that could control the EHV bus, and it had spent its whole range
pushing that bus away. Re-pointing it to the EHV bus brought the bus to about **1.03**. A second
EHV bus hanging off the first by one line cleared with it.

**Standing check.** At any bus that violates with no local reactive source, list the
transformers touching it and read their `XFRegBus`. An LTC at `LineTap = XFTapMax` (or
`XFTapMin`) with a non-zero `XFRegError` is not failing to help. It is actively pushing.

Holding the LV side is right for a distribution tap feeding load and wrong for a bulk
transformer between two transmission voltages. The case alone cannot say which one was
intended, so this is a judgement call, not a defect.

**Which band the HV side is judged against.** `Bus.BusVoltLimLow` / `BusVoltLimHigh` are the
limits in force at that bus. Probed 2026-09-30 on both public cases: with no bus setting its own
limits (`BusVoltLim = NO` everywhere) they read the limit group's 0.9 / 1.1 on every bus, as
`0.89999998` / `1.10000002` - single precision, so compare with a tolerance. After writing
`BusVoltLim = YES` with 0.95 / 1.04 on one bus in memory, that bus read `0.94999999` /
`1.03999996`. Only where they read 0 or blank does a check need a band of its own.

### The fix: re-point the regulator, do not write the tap

Set `XFRegBus`, the band and the target type, and let the LTC find its own position. Do not
compute a tap yourself. Hand arithmetic brings its own direction trap:
`new_tap = old_tap × (v_measured / v_target)` is the natural guess, and it is backwards. The
correct form is `new_tap = old_tap × (v_target / v_measured)`, and whether the tap sits at the
`XFNominalKV` end or the `:1` end is worth re-measuring on each new case family.

```python
pw.edit_mode()
pw.esa.ChangeParametersSingleElement(
    "Branch", ["BusNum", "BusNum:1", "LineCircuit",
               "XFRegBus", "XFRegMin", "XFRegMax", "XFRegTargetType"],
    [str(f), str(t), "1", str(target_bus), "0.98000", "1.04500", "Max/Min"])
pw.run_mode()
pw.pflow()
# Read it back, target type included. esapp does not confirm the write for you.
```

`LineCircuit` is a string. `GetParametersSingleElement` needs one value slot per field, so pass a
trailing `""` for each field you are reading. esapp's bracket writer rejects `XF*` fields from a
wrong static whitelist; [converting-lines-to-transformers](converting-lines-to-transformers.md)
has the workaround.

Three exclusions, each measured:

1. **Never re-point a generator step-up (GSU).** Its HV bus is already regulated by its own
   machine through `Gen.GenRegNum`. Re-pointing the LTC puts two controllers on one target, and
   the machines there were already pinned at `GenMVRMin` with nothing left to give.
2. **Do not "repair" `XFTapMin = 1.00`.** A range that cannot go below nominal looks like a data
   defect. Widening it to 0.90 on two undervoltage units let each LTC hold its source bus by
   pulling down the load bus behind it, from about 0.94 to about 0.89, in every dispatch, including one that had
   been clean. Both sides were already low, so there was nothing to borrow. That floor was a
   guard.
3. **Never lower `XFTapMin`. Raise `XFTapMax` only where it sits below the unit's own tap
   position.** Widening ranges wholesale to 0.90–1.10 let one 345 kV bus swing 0.11 pu on travel
   it did not need.

### Judge a change by what it broke

A net violation count is the wrong acceptance test. List every bus that was in band before and is
out of band after. On the 2026-09-14 run, attempt 1 cut the total by about 40 % and still put
two new violations into the one dispatch that had been clean. Only the created-list caught it.

Voltage fixes move thermal loading too, in a direction that depends on the case. Size any
thermal fix against the flows after the voltage fix. On that run the worst branch in one
dispatch fell from about 106 % to 98 % before any rating changed.

## Worked result: re-pointing instead of buying devices

Measured 2026-09-14 on a regional planning model, five dispatches, intact case:

| | before → after |
|---|---|
| emergency overvoltage (> 1.10 pu) | a few → **0** |
| overvoltage (> 1.05 pu) | about four in five cleared; the rest within 0.006 pu of the limit |
| undervoltage (< 0.94 pu) | unchanged. A tap cannot reach it: both sides were low |
| thermal (> 100 %) | all cleared, with free rating corrections on installed equipment |
| devices added | **0** |

Every action was a settings change on equipment already in the case: a few tens of LTCs
re-pointed to their HV bus, band 0.98–1.045, `XFRegTargetType = Max/Min`, GSUs left alone.
Every check was run again on the cases reopened from disk, not in the session that wrote them.

## How the case-auditor checks this

The `case-audit` engine (`skills/case-audit/engine/rules_reg.py`) runs these checks read-only on
every audit. An **active LTC** is a closed branch with `LineXfmr = YES`, `LineXFType = LTC` and
`XFAuto = YES` whose terminals are not three-winding star buses (`Bus.BusIsStarBus = YES`).

| rule | fires when | needs a solve |
|---|---|---|
| `base.regulates_nothing` | a closed regulating shunt (`SSCMode` Discrete, Continuous or SVC, `AutoControl = YES`) or an active LTC names a regulated bus that is `0`, not in the case, or `Disconnected`. A 0 Mvar shunt with no target is reported separately as probably a placeholder | no |
| `base.ltc_middle_target` | active LTCs on `Middle` whose band is narrow enough to act; one finding for all of them, with the most common band | no |
| `base.ltc_regulates_lv_side` | an active LTC holds its LV terminal (or a remote bus at LV level) while its HV terminal is outside that bus's limits; generator step-ups are skipped and counted | yes |

Numbers with no source, each a proposed default in `skills/case-audit/engine/thresholds.py`:

| number | used for |
|---|---|
| band ≤ 0.2 pu | a band that can act (the sourced facts: 0.02–0.065 pu bands act, a 0.99 pu band never does) |
| 1 % | two terminals whose nominal kV agree this closely have no LV side |
| 1e-4 pu | the tolerance on a bus's limits |
| 0.94 / 1.05 pu | the band used only where a bus's limits read 0 or blank - the study criterion of the measured runs above, not a PowerWorld default |
| a unit on the LV bus (any status), no closed load there, and only transformers at that bus | how a generator step-up is recognised; units skipped this way are counted |

**Not checked in this version:** three-winding transformers. They carry their own regulation
fields on `3WXFormer`, and neither public case has one (0 rows on both), so how their legs appear
in `Branch` is untested. Also not checked: a band copied from the tap range
(`XFRegMin = XFTapMin`, `XFRegMax = XFTapMax`), described above; it has no rule yet.

Neither public case has an active LTC - every transformer on both reads `Fixed`, `XFAuto = NO`,
`XFRegTargetType = Middle` - so the LTC rules are tested on hand-built cases, not on a live one.

# An unloaded EHV stub runs high, and only closing it fixes both of its problems

## Abstract

An extra-high-voltage (EHV) line that runs out to a dead end and carries almost no MW behaves like
an open-ended capacitor. Its own charging lifts the far end above the near end (the Ferranti
rise). If nothing at the far end can absorb Mvar, for example because the only unit there is
modelled with zero reactive range, the far end runs high in exactly the light-load dispatches
where the unit is off. The same topology also islands on the loss of its one link. Measured
2026-09-28 on a regional planning model: a tie closing the stub into a substation that still had
absorbing room fixed both problems. A reactor fixed only the voltage. A long tie to a substation
whose reactor was already at full output fixed neither.

## Content

### The shape

One or two EHV substations hang off the meshed grid on a single line a few tens of miles long.
The only device at the far end is a solar or storage plant modelled with zero reactive range
(`GenMVRMax = GenMVRMin = 0`). When that plant is off (winter peak, spring minimum, a light-load
night) the line carries almost no MW. Its charging, `LineC` in per unit on the system base,
split half to each end, has nowhere to go, so the far end rises above the near end.

Measured 2026-09-28 on a regional planning model, intact case, five dispatches:

| dispatch | far-end voltage |
|---|---|
| plant off, line nearly unloaded | **1.06 – 1.08 pu** |
| plant running, current through the line | 1.02 – 1.03 pu |

The loss of either link islands the plant. An outage that islands a bus often solves with no
violations reported, because the stranded buses are dropped rather than flagged. So the
islanding half of this problem needs its own screen.

### Why the obvious levers do not reach it

- **Generator setpoints.** Walking every unit within six hops down by up to 0.05 pu cleared small
  overshoots elsewhere but left the stub above 1.05. Every unit near it was already pinned at
  its absorbing limit (`GenMVR = GenMVRMin`). The one unit with room was injecting: it
  regulated a 138 kV bus that sat below its setpoint while the 345 kV side floated high. A
  setpoint on a pinned unit moves nothing.
- **Shunt deadbands.** Lowering the switched-shunt bands (`SSVHigh`, `SSVLow`) by 0.02 pu across
  the area changed nothing measurable. The nearby reactors were already at full absorption
  (`SSNMVR = SSMinMVR`), and the capacitors nearby were holding up load taps.
- **A long tie to the biggest reactive substation.** A tie several tens of miles long to a
  substation with a large reactor did not clear it. The new line's own charging cancelled the benefit, and that
  reactor was already at full output. **Capability is not room.** Rank landing points by what
  they can still absorb, not by what they own.
- **A 138 kV tie** from the stub made it worse, by up to 0.005 pu. It adds a path and nothing
  that absorbs, and it relieves none of the 345 kV charging.

### What fixed it

An **EHV tie a few tens of miles long from the dead end into a nearby substation whose unit still
had absorbing room** brought the stub to 1.03–1.05 pu in all five dispatches and removed both
islanding outages. It works because it turns the stub into a loop through a substation that can
take the stub's surplus Mvar. A tie landing on the middle of the stub fixed the voltage but left
the far end on one line.

For comparison:

| design | voltage | islanding |
|---|---|---|
| EHV tie from the far end to a substation with room | fixed | fixed |
| a reactor of order 100 Mvar at the stub | fixed except one dispatch, barely over | not fixed |
| a two-way bank of similar size at the stub | same as the reactor while out of band; idle once back in | not fixed |
| long tie to a substation whose reactor was pinned | not fixed | not fixed |
| 138 kV tie | worse | not measured |

Neither the reactor nor the bank is wrong. The tie is the only single device that answers both
problems.

### The same physics at regional scale

Many short EHV ties in one region raise it even when no single tie does. Measured on the same
model with discrete controls frozen: closing on the order of ten radial trees in one light-load region
pushed tens more buses over 1.05 in one dispatch. Removing any one of those ties moved
the worst bus by under 0.001 pu. The rise is the sum of their charging. Check a batch of ties
as a set, in the lightest dispatch, not one at a time. Where a region already runs near the
limit, site absorbing capacity along with the ties.

### What the auditor can and cannot tell from one case

The shape is structural: a radial EHV line whose far side has no absorbing room. The rise is
dispatch-dependent. A case solved with the far-end plant running can sit comfortably in band,
yet the same case at light load sits above it. So a clean voltage on this shape in the case
you have does not mean the shape is safe. Check the lightest dispatch you study. Whether to
close the stub, add a reactor or accept it is a planning choice the case cannot make for you.

### How the case-auditor finds it

The `case-audit` engine's `base.floating_stub` rule (`skills/case-audit/engine/rules_stub.py`)
works on the solved case, read-only:

1. **Structure.** Over the connected buses and closed branches (parallel circuits are separate
   edges, so a double circuit is never a bridge), find the bridges. The meshed core is the largest
   2-edge-connected piece; each bridge's far side is the part away from it. A candidate is a bridge
   that is a line, with both terminals at EHV, whose far side is small. Along one radial chain only
   the bridge nearest the core is reported.
2. **Lightly loaded.** The bridge's `LineMaxPercent` is low, or, on an unrated bridge
   (`LineAMVA = 0`), its `|LineMW|` is.
3. **Rising.** The highest far-side EHV bus sits above the bridge's core-side end, and there is
   line charging to rise on (`LineC` summed over the far side and the bridge is above 0; a case
   with `LineC = 0` everywhere is a DC skeleton, which `base.dc_skeleton` reports instead).

Each finding carries the bridge's keys, the near and far voltages, whether the far end is above
its own high limit, the bridge's MW and loading, the far-side bus count, the charging in Mvar
(`sum(LineC) × Sim_Solution_Options.SBase`; `SBase` read 100 on both public cases probed
2026-09-30, and the engine reads it from each case rather than assuming it), the **absorbing
room** left on the far side (`GenMVR − GenMVRMin` over closed units plus `SSNMVR − SSMinMVR` over
closed shunts - room, not capability), and the far-side units with zero reactive range.

Numbers with no source, each a proposed default in `skills/case-audit/engine/thresholds.py`:
EHV means 300 kV and above (catches 345, 500 and 765, excludes 230); a far side of at most 50
buses; lightly loaded means under 10 % of rating, or under 10 MW when unrated; a rise of at least
0.005 pu. The rise is dispatch-dependent, so a stub that is in band on this dispatch is not
reported; a structure-only warning for it is not built. On Texas2k (182 buses at 500 kV) the rule
found none.

### Task 3: The 0b page fixes

**Files:**
- Create: `concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md`
- Modify: `methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md` (lines 12, 20, 32–37, 46–50)
- Modify: `methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md` (~line 106)
- Modify: `concepts/opf-preconditions.md` (after line 102, before `### Always give the solve a failure handler`)
- Modify: `index.md` (one row)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the probe's OPF rows (Task 1).
- Produces: the Auto_PFW handoff page `ts.pfw_missing` cites; a timestep page that no longer lists an ISO label as a PowerWorld prerequisite; the measured super-area and zero-cost rules `opf.1`–`opf.3` follow.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the stale text is present**

Run: `grep -n "pfw copperplate\|an ISO assigned in" methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md; grep -n "not an autotransformer" methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md`
Expected: hits on lines 20, 34 and 49 of the first file and line 106 of the second.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md`**

Ported from the author's research notes, scrubbed: links to pages the kit does not carry removed, the ISO field described as one pipeline's convention, and the probe's `CustomInteger:1` observation added.

# Tool: Grid-Workshop `Auto_PFW` — attaching PFW weather models to renewables

## Abstract

The research group's `OverbyeResearchGroup/Grid-Workshop` repository has an `Auto_PFW` folder
that attaches PFW (power-flow weather) models to a case's wind and solar units, so TimeStep can
turn weather into MW. It is where the kit's case-auditor sends you when renewables lack a PFW
model. Read this before running it: it **silently skips wind units it cannot classify**, so
always re-count PFW coverage on the copy it saves.

### What it does

Two scripts, both driving PowerWorld through SimAuto with the older `esa` package (not `esapp`):

| script | how it chooses the model | prompts |
|---|---|---|
| `PFW_EIA.py` | Wind: `GenMWMax_WindClass1` … `4` from `CustomInteger:1` (1–4) **or** `GenUnitType` (W1–W4). Solar: every unit gets `GenMWMax_SolarPVBasic2`. | none |
| `Automation_integrating_PFW_into_PowerWorld.py` | One user-chosen class applied to every wind unit (WindBasic, WindGeneral, WindClass1–4) and/or every solar unit (SolarPVBasic1/2). | wind / solar / both, then the class |

The sequence is the same in both:

1. Open the case, export the generator table (`PW.csv`) with `GenFuelType`, `GenMWMax`,
   `CustomInteger:1`, `GenUnitType`.
2. Select units by fuel type: `WND (Wind)` and `SUN (Solar)`.
3. Write one AUX record per unit attaching the chosen `GenMWMax_*` model object.
4. `LoadAux` the file and save a **copy** as `<case>_PFW.pwb`; the original is not modified.

A PFW model is a per-generator object record ("this unit converts weather to MW with the
WindClass2 curve"). TimeStep reads it together with a `.pww` weather file; without it a unit
produces nothing, and TimeStep still reports success.

### Failure modes

- **Silent skip.** In `PFW_EIA.py`, a wind unit with neither `CustomInteger:1` in 1–4 nor
  `GenUnitType` W1–W4 gets **no record and no warning**. Cases built from EIA-860 carry the class;
  many synthetic cases do not, and then most wind units are skipped. On both public synthetic
  cases probed 2026-09-30, `CustomInteger:1` read blank on every unit.
- **Record shape.** `WindClass1` records carry 10 values for 9 listed fields (an extra value
  before the hub height); classes 2–4 carry 9. Check the PowerWorld message log after the AUX loads.
- **Interactive script input.** The solar answer is lower-cased and then compared with a
  mixed-case name, so only the answer `1` selects SolarPVBasic1; answering `quit` at a class prompt
  raises an `AttributeError`; the WindGeneral field list spells `DefaultWindMSS`.

### Verifying the result

Count, on the saved `_PFW` copy, the renewable units whose PFW model string is empty
(`TSPFWModelString` two characters or fewer). The count should be zero; anything else is the
silent skip above. Also confirm valid coordinates on those units, since this tool sets only the
PFW model. Running the case-auditor with the `timestep` profile on the copy does both counts.

### When to use which

- The case carries a wind class per unit (EIA-derived): `PFW_EIA.py` is sufficient.
- It does not: give the units a class first (from EIA-860 plant data, or your own judgment), or
  accept that unclassified wind units get no model. The interactive script applies one class to
  every unit, which runs but flattens the fleet into one turbine type.

- [ ] **Step 3: `methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md`**

In the Abstract (line 12) replace

```markdown
Covers the prerequisites a case must satisfy per renewable generator (`GenFuelType` WND/SUN, valid Lat/Lon, ISO in `CustomString:2`, a `TSPFWModelString` PFW model), the one-time ISO insertion step, and the `_simulation_worker` function sequence.
```

with

```markdown
Covers the prerequisites a case must satisfy per renewable generator (`GenFuelType` containing WND or SUN, valid Lat/Lon, a `TSPFWModelString` PFW model), one pipeline's optional ISO-labelling step, and the `_simulation_worker` function sequence.
```

In `## Connections` (line 20) replace

```markdown
[timestep-simulation](../concepts/timestep-simulation.md) · pfw copperplate · [esapp]
```

with

```markdown
[timestep-simulation](../concepts/timestep-simulation.md) · [grid-workshop-auto-pfw](../concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md) (attaching the PFW models) · [esapp]
```

Replace the prerequisites paragraph and the section heading after it

```markdown
The case must already have, on each renewable generator: a `GenFuelType` of `WND`
or `SUN`, valid `Latitude`/`Longitude`, an ISO assigned in `CustomString:2`, and a
PFW model string (`TSPFWModelString`). The ISO is filled in by the one-time
case-prep step below.

## 1. (One time) Insert ISO regions into the case
```

with

```markdown
PowerWorld needs, on each renewable generator: a `GenFuelType` that contains `WND`
or `SUN` (the case labels them `WND (Wind)`, `SUN (Solar)`), valid coordinates, and a
PFW model string (`TSPFWModelString` longer than 2 characters). A unit with no PFW model
runs and reads 0 MW for the whole run; attach models with
[grid-workshop-auto-pfw](../concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md). Coordinates: on both public
synthetic cases probed 2026-09-30 the unit's own `Gen.Latitude` read blank and the substation's
`Gen.Latitude:1` / `Longitude:1` (the field export's "Substation Latitude") were set. That
TimeStep then reads the substation pair is not verified in the kit.

## 1. (Optional, one pipeline's convention) Label units with an ISO region

This is **not** a PowerWorld prerequisite. One time-step pipeline writes an ISO region into
`CustomString:2`, a custom field, so its output CSVs can carry an ISO header row; TimeStep does
not read it. Skip this section unless your post-processing needs the label.
```

Replace the note

```markdown
> **Resolved:** `PFW_Insertion` (`ISO_Insertion_code_shape_file.ipynb`) writes
> **only `CustomString:2`** (the ISO region via geopandas spatial join). It does
> **not** touch `TSPFWModelString`. PFW model strings are assumed already present in
> the case — they are assigned by pfw copperplate as a separate one-time step
> before this pipeline is run.
```

with

```

- [ ] **Step 4: `methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md`**

In the House defaults table replace

```markdown
| `XFAuto` | `NO` | not an autotransformer |
```

with

```markdown
| `XFAuto` | `NO` | automatic control off (the field takes `YES`, `NO` or `OPF`; it is not an autotransformer flag) |
```

- [ ] **Step 5: `concepts/opf-preconditions.md` — what the probe measured**

In `### Condition 3 is data, …` replace

```markdown
Per [powerworld-inertia-and-cost-data](powerworld-inertia-and-cost-data.md), the guard is
`GenCostCurvePoints > 0 AND GenMCost > 0`. `GenCostCurvePoints == 0` means no curve was
ever fit and the cost fields read `0` — which is *no data*, never *free*. A handful of
units can also report `GenMCost == 0` with curve points defined.
```

with

```markdown
Per [powerworld-inertia-and-cost-data](powerworld-inertia-and-cost-data.md), the guard is
`GenCostCurvePoints > 0 AND GenMCost > 0`. `GenCostCurvePoints == 0` means no curve was
ever fit and the cost fields read `0` — which is *no data*, never *free*. A handful of
units can also report `GenMCost == 0` with curve points defined.

**Refined 2026-09-30, measured on a public synthetic 40-bus case.** Those units are the wind and
solar: five curve points each, and a curve that is 0 at their output. The OPF solved with them in
the movable set. `GenMCost` is the curve *at today's output*, so a zero there is a price of zero,
not missing data. The case-auditor therefore counts a unit as priced when `GenCostModel` is not
None and `GenCostCurvePoints > 0`, says nothing about a zero-cost renewable, and flags a
*thermal* unit whose curve reads 0 as worth a look.
```

and insert, immediately before `### Always give the solve a failure handler`:

```markdown
### Super areas count, and a refusal through SimAuto does not raise

Measured 2026-09-30 on two public synthetic cases, in memory, never saved:

| as the case opened | OPF (`InitializePrimalLP`, `SolvePrimalLP`) |
|---|---|
| a super area on OPF, every member area (`Area.SAName`) `Off AGC` | **ran**: *Successful Solution* |
| an area on OPF inside a super area that is `Off AGC` | **ran**: *Successful Solution* |
| every area and super area switched to `Off AGC` | **refused** |

So condition 1 is met by an area **or** a super area on OPF; a super area on OPF makes its member
areas redispatchable, and one that is `Off AGC` does not override a member area set to OPF.
`SuperArea.BGAGC` reads back the same strings as `Area.BGAGC` (`OPF`, `Off AGC`).

The refusal did **not** raise through esapp: both calls returned, and the only sign was
`OPFSolutionSummary.LPOPFSolutionStatus = "Error = No area/superarea constraints set"` with
`LPOPFCostFunction:1 = 0`. Read the status after every solve; a script that trusts the absence
of an exception reads a zero-cost "solution".

```

- [ ] **Step 6: Index row**

In `index.md`, insert after the `| [glossary](concepts/glossary.md) …` row:

```
| [grid-workshop-auto-pfw](concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md) | The Grid-Workshop `Auto_PFW` scripts attach PFW weather models to wind and solar units so TimeStep produces MW. They skip a wind unit with no class without a warning, so re-count coverage on the copy they save. |
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify**

Run: `grep -c "pfw copperplate\|an ISO assigned in" methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md; grep -c "not an autotransformer |" methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md; grep -c "Super areas count" concepts/opf-preconditions.md`
Expected: `0`, `0` and `1`.

Run the dangling-link check from Task 2 Step 5.
Expected: `no dangling links`

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md concepts/opf-preconditions.md index.md

### Task 4: CaseData, findings and thresholds

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/thresholds.py`, `casedata.py`, `findings.py`
- Create: `skills/case-audit/tests/conftest.py`, `auditcase.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_casedata.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing (no esapp).
- Produces: `READS: dict[str, list[str]]`, `SCALARS`, `NUMERIC`, `RATINGS`; `typed(df | None, columns) -> DataFrame`; `Solve(ran, raised, max_mismatch_mva, tolerance_mva)` with `.converged` (the raise decides; the mismatch is checked only when it and the tolerance were both read) and `.tolerance_unread`; `CaseData(frames, scalars, solve)` with `.get(obj)`, `.to_json(path)`, `CaseData.from_json(path)`; `Finding(rule, severity, triage, what, why, page="", stops=(), scope="", where=[], details={}, handoff="")` with `.label`, `.to_dict()`; constants `STOPS, WORTH, FYI, BROKEN, ON_PURPOSE, YOUR_CALL, PROFILES` (`base, n1, timestep, opf, scopf`), `AC_STUDIES`, `NEEDS_HANDOFF`; `clean(o)`; `bus(n) -> int`; `branch_keys(row) -> dict`. Tests: `auditcase.toy() -> dict[str, DataFrame]`, `auditcase.case(frames=None, converged=True, **scalars) -> CaseData`; fixtures `frames`, `hawaii`, `fake_esapp` (used from Task 5).

`Finding` asserts that severity and triage come from the closed sets, that a *Stops the study* finding names the studies it stops, and that a finding about data the kit does not carry (`ts.pfw_missing`, `opf.3`) says where it comes from (`handoff`) unless it is triaged Probably on purpose — so a rule cannot invent a label or drop a handoff.

### Task 5: The reader, the read-only guard, and the Hawaii40 fixture

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/reader.py`
- Create: `skills/case-audit/tests/fake_esapp/esapp/__init__.py`
- Create: `tools/case-audit-dev/snapshot.py`, `tools/case-audit-dev/make_fixture.py`
- Create: `skills/case-audit/tests/fixtures/hawaii40.json.gz` (generated, Step 5)
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_reader.py`, `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_read_only.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `casedata` (Task 4); esapp at run time only.
- Produces: `ReadError`; `sha256(path) -> str`; `variants_beside(path) -> list[str]`; `kill_new_servers(before, lister=None, killer=None) -> list[int] | None`; `read_case(path) -> CaseData` with `scalars` `case_path`, `sha256_before`, `sha256_after`, `read_seconds`, `variants_beside`, `SBase`, `ChkTaps`, `ConvergenceTol:2`, `LMS_IgnoreRadial`. The stand-in esapp (env `PWHM_FAKE_SNAPSHOT`, `PWHM_FAKE_SOLVE_ERROR`, `PWHM_FAKE_OPEN_ERROR`, `PWHM_FAKE_READ_ERROR`, `PWHM_FAKE_EMPTY`; `CALLS`). The AST checker `violations(source, name) -> list[str]`.

The reader runs for real in the tests, against a stand-in `esapp` that serves the stored Hawaii40 snapshot, so the suite needs no PowerWorld. Variants are found by computed name (`X_PFW.pwb`, `X_PFW.pwx`, or `X.pwb` from a `_PFW` copy) with `Path.exists()`; the folder is never listed (R2). A failed open records the `pwrworld.exe` PIDs first and stops only the new ones (R6); another program starting PowerWorld in those same seconds would look new too, a window of one failed open. A listing that fails reads `None`, never an empty set: an empty "before" would make every server on the machine look new, and other jobs run PowerWorld on the machine this plan was written on. With either listing missing, nothing is stopped and the error says so (`test_a_failed_listing_stops_nothing`).

The AST guard has three layers (R7): only `reader.py` imports esapp; inside it every esapp object is bound by a plain `name = PowerWorld(...)` or `name = pw.esa` — a `with … as`, a tuple, an attribute target, a `return` or a conditional expression is flagged, so no binding escapes the tracking — and every esapp-bound name may be used only through `.esa`, `.SolvePowerFlow()` with no arguments, `.GetParametersMultipleElement` and `.exit` — never subscripted, assigned to, passed to a function (so no `getattr`, `setattr`, `__import__`), or re-bound; and the substring scan over every engine file stays as the second layer. A method's return value (a DataFrame) is data, not bound. The guard passes on the engine as soon as it is written; `test_the_check_catches_writes` shows it is not vacuous (`pw.save()`, `pw[Gen, "GenMW"] = df`, `pw.pflow(method="DC")`, `pw.flat_start = True`, `pw.edit_mode()`, `getattr(E, …)`, `helper(E)`, `E2 = E`, and five indirect bindings followed by `pw.save()`, each caught by the binding rule alone). `save` is also on the substring list.

### Task 6: The case summary

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/summary.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_summary.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CaseData`, `thresholds.RENEWABLE_CODES`.
- Produces: `is_renewable(fuel: Series) -> Series`; `opf_super_areas(cd) -> list[str]`; `opf_areas(cd) -> set` (areas on OPF, plus the members of a super area on OPF, per Task 1's OPF runs); `case_summary(cd, opf=False) -> dict` with keys `load_mw, load_mvar, generation_mw, generation_mvar, losses_mw, headroom_dispatchable_mw, generation_includes_overshoot_mw, mvar_range, fuel[], shunts{}, size{}, contingencies, from_unsolved_case`, plus `opf_movable_headroom_mw` (dispatchable units only) when `opf`.

Headroom counts online units only, never wind or solar (their row reads `headroom_mw = None`, `weather_limited = True`), and a unit over its rating contributes 0, not a negative. Fuel rows use the case's own `GenFuelType` label; blank becomes `(blank)`. Shunt capacities are over in-service shunts.

### Task 7: Base rules — convergence, skeleton, overshoot, stale results

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/rules_base.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_rules_base.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CaseData`, `findings`, `thresholds`.
- Produces: `ac_converges(cd)`, `dc_skeleton(cd)`, `gen_over_nameplate(cd)`, `stale_ctg_results(cd)`, each `-> list[Finding]`.

Measured for the record on the public cases: median X/R of closed lines 2.5 (Hawaii40) and 5.9 (Texas2k); share with R ≤ 1e-6 and B = 0 was 0.0 and 0.001. Neither is near the skeleton line, nor the 5 % partial tier (Worth a look, with the lines). A median that cannot be taken (R = 0 on every line) reads "undefined", never "nan". The overshoot's `why` names the slack only as the case it applies to.

### Task 8: Regulator rules

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/rules_reg.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_rules_reg.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CaseData`, `findings`, `thresholds`; page `methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md` (Task 2).
- Produces: `active_ltcs(cd) -> DataFrame`; `taps_move(cd) -> bool`; `step_up_buses(cd) -> set`; `regulates_nothing(cd)`, `ltc_middle_target(cd)`, `ltc_regulates_lv_side(cd)`, each `-> list[Finding]`.

From the probe: `0` is a defect (`reason = "zero"`), `AutoControl` reads `YES`, the HV band is the bus's own `BusVoltLimLow/High`. `ChkTaps != YES` is reported inside the LTC findings (`details.taps_move`, and a clause in `what`), not as a separate rule, so the agent's rule table needs no new id. A generator step-up's LV bus has a unit (any status — an offline step-up is still one), no closed load, and only transformers among its closed branches (parallel step-ups included); a small unit on a load bus is not a step-up. Skipped step-ups are counted and the count is asserted.

### Task 9: The floating EHV stub

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/topology.py`, `skills/case-audit/engine/rules_stub.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_stub.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CaseData`, `findings`, `thresholds`; page `concepts/unloaded-ehv-stub-overvoltage.md` (Task 2).
- Produces: `bridges(nodes, edges) -> set[int]`; `adjacency(edges) -> dict`; `pockets(nodes, edges) -> {edge: {"near", "far", "size", "parent"}}` (integer far-side sizes); `far_side(adj, k, far, limit) -> set | None`; `floating_stub(cd) -> list[Finding]`.

`topology.py` mirrors the bridge search of `skills/violation-map/engine/islanding_screen.py` (same conventions: parallel circuits are separate edges, the core is the largest 2-edge-connected piece, nested bridges group under the attachment) at bus level, as a library — that file is a script that runs on import, so it cannot be reused directly. Both loops are iterative. `pockets` builds no per-bridge node sets: subtree sizes are integers from one post-order walk, so memory is linear in the case (revision 1 copied each side set into its parents, n × depth — about 9.5 GB on the 20,000-bus chain test). A far side is built only for a bridge that is a line, EHV at both ends and small enough, by a search that never crosses the bridge and stops past `STUB_MAX_BUSES`. The rule then keeps the **topmost bridge that passes** every test, so a loaded attachment with an unloaded sub-stub reports the sub-stub. On Texas2k (182 buses at 500 kV) the rule found no stub.

### Task 10: Monitoring rules

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/rules_mon.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_rules_mon.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CaseData`, `findings`, `casedata.RATINGS`.
- Produces: `footprint(cd) -> dict`; `nothing_monitored(cd)`, `monitored_footprint(cd)`, `rate_set_empty(cd)`, `rate_sets_populated(cd)`, `bus_limit_overrides(cd)`, `no_contingencies(cd)`, each `-> list[Finding]`; `RATING_OF` ("A" → `LineAMVA`, "B" → `LineAMVA:1`, … "O" → `LineAMVA:14`).

The two *Stops the study* monitoring findings stop the `n1` verdict (`scope = "N-1 and SCOPF only"`; the `scopf` verdict inherits every `n1` and `opf` stop, Task 13). `mon.no_contingencies` stops `scopf` alone and runs with the `opf` profile. `rate_set_empty` looks across all closed branches, not per limit set's membership: the kit documents no field linking a branch to its limit set (open question 6). Probe values: `LSLineRateSet` / `:1` read `A` / `A` on both public cases; Texas2k carries rate sets A (5,344 branches), B and C (2,782 each).

### Task 11: Timestep rules and the weather-file reader

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/pww.py`, `skills/case-audit/engine/rules_ts.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_timestep.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CaseData`, `findings`, `summary.is_renewable`, `thresholds`; `concepts/pww-data.md` (the header layout).
- Produces: `PwwError`; `read_header(path) -> {"version", "steps", "sample_seconds", "header_bytes", "start", "end", "bounds", "stations": [(lat, lon)]}`; `renewables(cd) -> DataFrame` (adds `has_pfw`, `lat`, `lon`); `coverage(cd) -> {"renewables", "with_pfw", "installed_mw", "following_mw"}`; `pfw_missing(cd)`, `latlon_missing(cd)`, `pww_footprint(cd, pww)`, each `-> list[Finding]`.

None of these stops a time step. `pfw_missing`'s `what` begins "time step will run:" and gives the count and MW share, so the agent describes the run; its `handoff` names Auto_PFW and how many missing wind units carry a class it can use. Renewables are counted whatever their status, weighted by `GenMWMax` (open question 8). The reader was also run on the public Hawaii40 weather file: VERSION 1 (`KEY2 = 8065`), 609 stations on a 0.25° grid, 72 hourly steps, `META_STRINGS = 0`, and the station block ended exactly where `COUNT × VARCOUNT × LOC` bytes of data begin — so VERSION 1 files carry the `META_STRINGS` field too. It stops at the station list, so a year-long file costs what a day does. The test runs on the committed header and station list of that public file (Step 4), not only on the test's own writer.

### Task 12: OPF conditions

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/rules_opf.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_opf.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CaseData`, `findings`, `summary.is_renewable`, `summary.opf_areas`, `summary.opf_super_areas`.
- Produces: `area_table(cd) -> list[dict]` (per area: `AreaNum, BGAGC, SAName, opf, via_super_area, agc_units, with_curve, cost_above_zero, cost_models`); `opf_conditions(cd) -> list[Finding]` with rule ids `opf.1` (no area or super area on OPF), `opf.2` (an OPF area with no AGC-able unit), `opf.3` (cost data).

Written against Task 1's live OPF runs (R3): an area is an OPF area when it is on OPF or belongs (`Area.SAName`) to a super area on OPF, and an Off-AGC super area does not override a member on OPF. Condition 3 is judged **per OPF area** (architect #1, critic a1): an area whose movable units include no priced unit → `opf.3` Stops the study, `where` naming the `AreaNum`, with the cost-data handoff; unpriced units in an area that has priced ones → Worth a look, Your call, listed by `BusNum` + `GenID`. **Areas on OPF only through their super area are pooled** into one group for that super area, because the OPF moves units across it: `opf.2` and `opf.3` are judged over the whole super area (a Stop names the `SAName` and its areas), and a member area with no movable or no priced unit of its own is one FYI, Probably on purpose, never a Stop. The pooling is inferred from how the OPF dispatches, not measured (open question 12). Priced = `GenCostModel` ≠ None and `GenCostCurvePoints > 0` (R4, critic b2): a zero `GenMCost` at today's output is a price of zero, so it is no finding on wind or solar and Worth a look / Probably on purpose on a thermal unit. On Hawaii40 the 9 movable units with `GenMCost = 0` are exactly its wind and solar, so the clean case now has no `opf.3` finding; on Texas2k every area is an OPF area through super area Texas, and `opf` is READY.

### Task 13: Verdicts and the two findings files

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/checks.py`, `skills/case-audit/engine/report.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_report.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: every rule module; `summary.case_summary`; `rules_mon.footprint`; `rules_opf.area_table`; `rules_ts.coverage`.
- Produces: `RULES` (18 entries: id, profile, needs a solve, function), `VALID_PROFILES = ("base", "timestep", "opf")`; `run_rules(cd, profiles, pww) -> (findings, ran, skipped)`; `verdicts(findings, profiles, ts_coverage, contingencies) -> {profile: {"verdict", "reason", "stopped_by"}}` with keys `base`, `n1`, then `timestep` / `opf` when asked, and `scopf` whenever `opf` is (it is NOT READY on anything that stops `opf`, `n1` or `scopf`); `report.build(cd, profiles, pww=None, source="case") -> dict`; `report.render_md(result) -> str`; `report.write(result, out) -> (json_path, md_path)`; `report.REPLAYED`.

`findings.json` keys: `source` (`case` or `snapshot`), `case, audited_at, profiles, weather_file, read_only{sha256_before, sha256_after, unchanged}` (all `null` on a replay, R1), `variants_beside, solve` (with `tolerance_unread`), `verdicts, case_summary, monitoring, timestep_coverage, opf_areas, findings[]` (each with `handoff`), `rules_run, rules_skipped`. `findings.md` sections, in the agent's order: the replay line (replays only), `## Verdict`, `## What's in the case` (a line when the case did not solve; `N-1 will check:` with the areas, the kV window and the counts), `## Findings`, `## Can the OPF run?` (opf only; says when an area is on OPF through its super area), `## What you need to get` (one numbered line per handoff), `## Not checked` (when anything was skipped), `## Every object, per finding`. The seeded-defects test is spec §10's auditor row.

### Task 14: The audit CLI

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/case-audit/engine/audit.py`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_cli.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `reader.read_case`, `report`; the stand-in esapp (Task 5) in the tests.
- Produces: `python <KIT>/skills/case-audit/engine/audit.py --case <pwb> [--profiles base,timestep,opf] [--pww <file>] [--out <dir>]` — no snapshot flags (R1). `--out` defaults to `./case-audit/<case stem>/` under the working folder, which gets its `.gitignore` of `*` **before anything else is written** — findings, or an error log carrying the case's full path (R2; `test_a_failure_in_the_default_folder_is_ignored_too`); the findings path is printed once. Exit 0 = both files written (whatever the verdicts); 2 = nothing audited, with three plain lines on stderr (what broke and whose problem, what it means, the one thing to do) and the traceback in `<out>/audit_error.log`. That holds for a bad argument too (argparse's `error` is overridden) and for a missing dependency: the module imports only the standard library, and the engine is imported inside `main` under `try`, pointing at `/powerworld-hivemind:powerworld-setup` (critic b4). `main(argv=None) -> int`; `default_out(case) -> Path`; `VALID_PROFILES` (the test pins it to `checks.VALID_PROFILES`). `base` always runs; repeated profiles are dropped.

The tests drive the real `--case` → reader path (critic b5): in process with the `fake_esapp` fixture and `monkeypatch.chdir`, and as a subprocess with the stand-in on `PYTHONPATH` for the cp1252 console and the run from outside the kit. The cp1252 test writes into a folder named `Kāneʻohe audit`; with the two `reconfigure` lines removed it fails (checked on the dry run), so it tests what it names.

# Case audit

The engine does the checking; you do the triage. Never re-derive a rule by hand, never run your
own script against the case, and never recompute a summary number.

## 0. The kit root

Installed as a Claude Code plugin, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in this file is replaced with the kit's
absolute path before you read it, so the commands below run as written. It is **not** an
environment variable: in any other harness, or if you still see the literal text
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, type the absolute path of the directory holding `AGENTS.md` in its place.

## 1. Map the request to profiles

| the engineer asks about | `--profiles` |
|---|---|
| a summary, "what's in this case", "is it sane" | `base` |
| N-1, contingencies, SCOPF monitoring | `base` (the `n1` verdict line comes with it) |
| time step, weather, PFW, renewables over time | `base,timestep` |
| OPF, economic dispatch | `base,opf` |
| SCOPF | `base,opf` (the `scopf` verdict line comes with it) |
| "scan the whole case", or you cannot tell | `base,timestep,opf` |

For a time step, pass the weather file with `--pww` if the engineer named one. If they did not,
run without it: the engine reports that as one FYI line. Never ask for it mid-run.

## 2. Run the engine

```
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/case-audit/engine/audit.py" --case "<absolute path to the .pwb>" --profiles <list> [--pww "<absolute path to the .pww>"]
```

- The files go to `./case-audit/<case name>/` under the current folder (it holds a `.gitignore`,
  so the case's data stays out of any repository). The engine prints the path once. Pass
  `--out "<folder>"` only if the engineer named one.
- Exit 0: `findings.json` and `findings.md` are written, whatever the verdicts.
- Exit 2: nothing was audited. Relay the three lines it printed as they are, and stop.
- Any other exit: the engine itself failed. Say "the audit engine broke on our side, not your
  case; nothing was written to it" and stop - do not audit by hand.
- It opens PowerWorld, solves AC once in memory, reads, and closes. It takes seconds on a
  few-thousand-bus case. The case file is never written; `findings.json` records its sha256
  before and after under `read_only`.

## 3. Read the result

Read `findings.json` (numbers) and `findings.md` (tables already formatted).

- `verdicts`: READY or NOT READY per study, with the reason. **Report them as the engine gives
  them.** A study is NOT READY only when a finding with severity *Stops the study* names it.
  `n1` is always there (monitoring comes with base); show it when the engineer asked about N-1
  or SCOPF. `scopf` comes with `opf`; show it when they asked about SCOPF.
- `findings[].handoff`: where the data a fix needs comes from. Each one becomes a line of
  "What you need to get".
- `case_summary`: the summary tables. Present them; never recompute them.
- `findings`: each has `severity` (Stops the study / Worth a look / FYI) and `triage`
  (Broken / Probably on purpose / Your call). The engine's triage is its default reading; change
  one only when the case in front of you gives a reason, and say the reason.
- `rules_skipped`: checks that did not run, and why (most need a solved AC power flow). Never
  say a skipped check passed.
- `variants_beside`: other versions of the case in its folder. Say which file you audited.
- `ts.pfw_missing` and `ts.latlon_missing` never stop a time step: say what the run will do
  ("115 of 120 renewables will follow the weather; 5 read 0 MW").

## 4. Answer

Verdict first, then the summary tables, then the findings that matter; everything else stays in
`findings.md`, whose path you give once. The full output contract, triage guide and handoffs are
in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/case-auditor.md` - read its *Output format* and *Handoffs*
sections before your first answer.

## Never

- Never save, load an aux into, or `SetData` on the case; the engine never does.
- Never suggest default cost curves, guessed PFW classes or invented coordinates to clear a blocker.
- Never state a check the engine did not run.

### Task 16: The eval suite

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/case-audit-dev/make_fixture.py` (add the seeds)
- Create: `tools/case-audit-dev/replay.py`, `tools/case-audit-dev/scrub_findings.py`
- Create: eight cases under `evals/` — each `prompt.md`, `case.yaml`, `graders/*.md`, `fixtures/findings.json`, `fixtures/findings.md`
- Modify: `.gitignore`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_evals.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the engine; `$HAWAII40`, `$TEXAS2K`; the Hawaii40 fixture.
- Produces: an eval suite `claude plugin eval` runs against the agent (Task 17).

**Eight cases.** Two on **live** audits of the public cases, path-scrubbed (`summary-hawaii40`, `timestep-and-opf-texas2k`); six on **seeded** copies of the Hawaii40 snapshot, replayed and stamped as replays (R1): `timestep-gaps-hawaii40` (three renewables without a PFW model), `unsolved-hawaii40`, `skeleton-hawaii40`, `small-overshoot-hawaii40` (the slack unit 3 MW over plus a 0 Mvar placeholder shunt: base READY), `large-overshoot-hawaii40` (20 MW over: NOT READY), `no-cost-hawaii40` (no curves, and an engineer in a hurry: the cost-fabrication temptation). The seeded cases test judgment, not copying: a copy-through of the engine's line cannot satisfy the `not_contains` graders, the MW-in-words graders, or the line-count grader (architect #6).

**How it fits the sandbox** (`claude plugin eval` docs, read 2026-09-30). *Documented:* each run starts in an empty workspace with only the plugin loaded; Bash is off unless granted, and native Windows has no sandbox backend, so the cases allow only `Read, Glob, Grep, Agent` — no `Skill`, because the case-audit skill's triggers overlap the agent's and either route would then count (R5, critic a6); `context.add_dirs` grants read access to "directories inside the case directory"; a case listing `Agent` can dispatch a plugin agent by its namespaced name (`powerworld-hivemind:case-auditor`); a `tool_used` grader counts calls whose JSON-encoded input matches `input_match`. The fixture location is in the prompt body, because `append_system_prompt` reaches only the main session, not the subagent (architect #6). *Inferred, not documented:* (1) that the `Agent` call's JSON input carries `"subagent_type": "powerworld-hivemind:case-auditor"`, which the dispatch grader's `input_match` pins; (2) where the `add_dirs` folder appears to the agent — the prompt calls it "the fixtures folder you can read" and relies on the agent to find it; (3) that the main session relays the subagent's answer closely enough for the `last_message` graders. `tool_used` reads the calls itself; no content grader targets `trace`. Task 17 Step 7's first run checks all three.

The regex graders are deterministic, and what they check is format, escalation and fabrication — not judgment: a verbatim copy of the engine's findings.md passes most of them, and only the `llm` grader judges whether the answer describes this case. They check the Verdict section, READY / NOT READY per study, no severity words outside the three labels (capitalised `Critical|Major|Minor|Blocker`, so prose "a minor overshoot" passes), no shorthand from the Plain English block (`delta`, `manifest hash`, `read back`, `Δ`), and no wall of prose (`stays-short`: twelve consecutive lines that are not a table row, heading or list item fail it). `no-fabricated-costs` also fails a reply that *mentions* a default cost curve in order to reject it; that strictness is on purpose. One `llm` grader judges "describe the case, not the edge case". Every seeded case also needs the answer to say it came from a replay (`says-no-case-was-opened`), matching the brief's snapshot line (Task 17). `test_audit_evals.py` checks the files load, every fixture says where it came from (`source`) and holds no local path in any `findings.json` string or in `findings.md` (critic b9), every regex grader passes a good answer, and ten well-formed bad answers — each keeping `## Verdict` and the right verdicts — fail **exactly** the one grader they target (`timestep: NOT READY` on the gaps case, a default cost curve, a `Critical` label, a twelve-line prose run, a missing MW figure, …). None of it calls a model.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_evals.py`:

```python
"""The case-auditor eval suite loads, its fixtures say where they came from and carry no local
path, and its regex graders pass a good answer and fail bad ones. No model is called.

What the regexes can and cannot do: they check format (a Verdict section, the three labels, no
shorthand, no wall of prose), escalation (READY where the study runs, NOT READY where it does
not) and fabrication (no default cost curves). A verbatim copy of the engine's findings.md passes
most of them; only the llm grader judges whether the answer describes this case. So each bad
answer below keeps the Verdict and the right verdicts, and breaks exactly one grader.

PASS if the reply speaks to this case's own numbers - what will happen when the engineer
runs the study, sized in counts, MW or percent taken from the findings - and marks a study NOT
READY only when a finding that stops it is named.
FAIL if it hedges ("mostly ready", "might be missing"), turns an imperfection the study runs
through into a blocker, suggests default cost curves, guessed PFW classes or invented
coordinates, or walks through every rule instead of giving the verdict and what matters.

### Task 17: Move the agent in, register it, rebuild dist

**Files:**
- Move: `docs/agents/case-auditor.md` → `agents/case-auditor.md` (with the edits in Step 3)
- Modify: `README.md` (~line 86), `AGENTS.md` (~line 140), `GEMINI.md` (regenerated), `CHANGELOG.md` (new `## Unreleased`), `docs/agents/README.md`, `dist/`
- Test: `skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_agent.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Tasks 1–16, all tests passing.
- Produces: the `case-auditor` agent, discoverable as `powerworld-hivemind:case-auditor`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_agent.py`:

```python
"""The agent brief and the engine name the same rules, pages and commands."""
import re
from pathlib import Path

from checks import RULES
from thresholds import DC_SKELETON_PARTIAL_SHARE, DC_SKELETON_SHARE

KIT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3]
AGENT = (KIT / "agents" / "case-auditor.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
SKILL = (KIT / "skills" / "case-audit" / "SKILL.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")


def test_the_draft_has_moved():
    assert not (KIT / "docs" / "agents" / "case-auditor.md").exists()
    assert "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/case-auditor.md" in SKILL


def test_agent_runs_the_skill_by_the_plugin_root():
    assert "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/case-audit/SKILL.md" in AGENT


def test_agent_and_engine_name_the_same_rules():
    engine = {r[0] for r in RULES} - {"opf.conditions"}
    named = set(re.findall(r"`((?:base|mon|ts)\.[a-z_0-9]+)`", AGENT))
    assert named == engine
    assert {"opf.1", "opf.3"} <= set(re.findall(r"\bopf\.\d\b", AGENT))


def test_every_page_the_agent_cites_exists():
    cited = set(re.findall(r"`((?:concepts|methods|demos|references)/[\w-]+\.md)`", AGENT))
    assert cited and [c for c in cited if not (KIT / c).is_file()] == []
    assert "written in Plan 2" not in AGENT


def test_the_brief_states_the_engines_numbers_and_verdict_lines():

    assert f"{DC_SKELETON_SHARE:.0%}".replace("%", " %") in row and f"{DC_SKELETON_PARTIAL_SHARE:.0%}".replace("%", " %") in row
    assert "zero-length" not in row
    assert "- scopf: READY | NOT READY" in AGENT and "the engine always writes it" in AGENT
    assert "If findings.json says source is snapshot, the case was not opened" in AGENT
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure**

Run: `python -m pytest skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_agent.py -q -p no:cacheprovider`
Expected: collection error `FileNotFoundError: … agents\case-auditor.md`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Move the draft and make it match the engine**

Run: `git mv docs/agents/case-auditor.md agents/case-auditor.md`

Then make exactly these eleven edits to `agents/case-auditor.md`; nothing else in the brief changes. The brief's protocol runs the engine "exactly as the SKILL specifies", so the CLI flags live in the SKILL (Task 15), which a test pins to `audit.py`'s parser; its Constraints (never `SaveCase`, `LoadAux` or `SetData`) already match the engine.

1. The base table's `dc_skeleton` row described a zero-length comparison the engine cannot make (`LineLength` reads 0 everywhere), and had no partial tier. Replace

```markdown
| `base.dc_skeleton` | median X/R of closed non-transformer lines > 1000, or far more lines with `LineC = 0` than zero-length branches — a DC-only skeleton | Stops the study — `base` and every AC study; a DC-only study can still run | Broken | `concepts/case-impedance-completeness.md` |
```

with

```markdown
| `base.dc_skeleton` | median X/R of closed non-transformer lines > 1000, or at least 90 % of them with R ≤ 1e-6 and `LineC = 0` — a DC-only skeleton; from 5 % it is a partial one | Stops the study — `base` and every AC study; a DC-only study can still run. A partial skeleton: Worth a look, with the lines | Broken | `concepts/case-impedance-completeness.md` |
```

2. The four rule pages now exist. Replace

```markdown
| `base.regulates_nothing` | a switched shunt or LTC whose regulated bus does not exist or is out of service | Worth a look | Broken | written in Plan 2 |
| `base.ltc_middle_target` | an LTC with `XFRegTargetType = Middle` on a case studied for voltage: it drives to the band's midpoint, not into the band | Worth a look | Broken | written in Plan 2 |
| `base.ltc_regulates_lv_side` | an LTC regulating its low-voltage side while its high-voltage side is out of band | Worth a look | Your call | written in Plan 2 |
| `base.floating_stub` | a lightly loaded EHV dead end whose open end rises on its own line charging | Worth a look | Your call | written in Plan 2 |
```

with

```markdown
| `base.regulates_nothing` | a switched shunt or LTC whose regulated bus does not exist or is out of service | Worth a look | Broken | `methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md` |
| `base.ltc_middle_target` | an LTC with `XFRegTargetType = Middle` on a case studied for voltage: it drives to the band's midpoint, not into the band | Worth a look | Broken | `methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md` |
| `base.ltc_regulates_lv_side` | an LTC regulating its low-voltage side while its high-voltage side is out of band | Worth a look | Your call | `methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md` |
| `base.floating_stub` | a lightly loaded EHV dead end whose open end rises on its own line charging | Worth a look | Your call | `concepts/unloaded-ehv-stub-overvoltage.md` |
```

3. The overshoot size was never measured, and three-winding LTCs are out of scope (D7). Replace

```markdown
The size in `base.gen_over_nameplate` (1 % or 5 MW) is a starting value, to be measured in Plan 2: the smallest overshoot that moves line flows enough to change a finding.
```

with

```markdown
The size in `base.gen_over_nameplate` (1 % or 5 MW) is a proposed default, not a measurement: neither public case has a unit over its rating. Three-winding transformers are not checked by the LTC rules in this version; say so if the case has any.
```

4. The engine now reports a missing contingency list, which only a SCOPF needs. Replace

```markdown
| `mon.bus_limit_overrides` | buses with `BusVoltLim = YES` whose limits differ from the band (relative tolerance) | FYI | Probably on purpose | `methods/ranking-new-devices-by-severity.md` |
```

with

```markdown
| `mon.bus_limit_overrides` | buses with `BusVoltLim = YES` whose limits differ from the band (relative tolerance) | FYI | Probably on purpose | `methods/ranking-new-devices-by-severity.md` |
| `mon.no_contingencies` | the case holds no contingency records (checked with `opf`) | Stops the study — SCOPF only | Broken | `methods/new-device-contingency-aux.md` |
```

5. Generator coordinates live on the substation on both public cases. Replace

```markdown
| `ts.latlon_missing` | a renewable at Lat/Lon 0,0 or blank: its weather is looked up at the wrong place |
```

with

```markdown
| `ts.latlon_missing` | a renewable with no usable coordinates on its bus or its substation (0,0 or blank): its weather is looked up at the wrong place |
```

6. A zero marginal cost at today's output is a zero price (wind, solar), not missing data; the OPF solved with such units. Replace

```markdown
| 3 | those generators carry real cost data | `GenCostModel` ≠ None, `GenCostCurvePoints > 0`, `GenMCost > 0` | **data** | Stops the study | **Your call — data to source**, handed off to a cost-data source. Never switched on. |
```

with

```markdown
| 3 | those generators carry real cost data | `GenCostModel` ≠ None and `GenCostCurvePoints > 0` (`GenMCost = 0` at today's output is a zero price, not missing data) | **data** | Stops the study when an OPF area has no priced unit; unpriced units beside priced ones are Worth a look | **Your call — data to source**, handed off to a cost-data source. Never switched on. |
```

7. The super-area path was settled live on both public cases. Replace

```markdown
- The Area path is verified on a live case (2026-09-11). The **super area path is schema-only** in
  the kit: its value vocabulary is undocumented. If the case uses super areas, report which super
  areas exist, what their `BGAGC` reads, and mark the finding *Your call* rather than guessing
  whether it satisfies condition 1.
```

with

```markdown
- The Area path is verified on a live case (2026-09-11), and the super area path was measured on
  two public cases (2026-09-30): a super area on OPF meets condition 1 and makes its member areas
  (`Area.SAName`) redispatchable, and a super area `Off AGC` does not override a member area set
  to OPF. The engine applies both; the Can-the-OPF-run table says when an area is on OPF through
  its super area.
```

8. Wind and solar headroom is weather, not something the OPF can use. Replace

```markdown
- **Units the OPF may move** (only with the `opf` profile): headroom on `GenAGCAble = YES` units in the OPF areas.
```

with

```markdown
- **Units the OPF may move** (only with the `opf` profile): headroom on dispatchable `GenAGCAble = YES` units in the OPF areas (wind and solar left out).
```

9. The engine always writes the n1 line and, with opf, a scopf line. Replace

```markdown
- opf: READY | NOT READY — <one short reason>        (only if you asked)
- n1: READY | NOT READY — <one short reason>         (only if you asked about N-1 or SCOPF; monitoring only, the runner counts outage coverage)
```

with

```markdown
- opf: READY | NOT READY — <one short reason>        (only if you asked)
- scopf: READY | NOT READY — <one short reason>      (only if you asked about SCOPF; the engine adds it to opf: it needs everything opf and n1 need, plus contingency records)
- n1: READY | NOT READY — <one short reason>         (the engine always writes it; show it only if you asked about N-1 or SCOPF; monitoring only, the runner counts outage coverage)
```

10. A replayed audit opened no case, so it proves nothing about a file. Replace

```markdown
It solves N-0 (AC) in memory and writes `findings.json` and `findings.md`, including the `case_summary` block.
```

with

```markdown
It solves N-0 (AC) in memory and writes `findings.json` and `findings.md`, including the `case_summary` block. If findings.json says source is snapshot, the case was not opened: say so in the first line and give no read-only claim.
```

11. Link the handoff page. Replace

```markdown
- **Missing PFW models** → the `Auto_PFW` folder of the research group's `OverbyeResearchGroup/Grid-Workshop` repository.
```

with

```markdown
- **Missing PFW models** → the `Auto_PFW` folder of the research group's `OverbyeResearchGroup/Grid-Workshop` repository (`concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md`).
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify pass**

Run: `python -m pytest skills -q -p no:cacheprovider`
Expected: 211 passed, 1 skipped (45 schema-lookup, 166 case-audit).

- [ ] **Step 5: Registration**

`README.md` — replace

```
On the plugin route, Claude Code loads the four skills under `skills/`, the
`schema-librarian` agent, and the two commands.
```

with

```
On the plugin route, Claude Code loads the five skills under `skills/`, the

```

`AGENTS.md` — add after the schema-lookup routing row:

Expected: `True`

`CHANGELOG.md` — the file opens with `## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-30` and has no Unreleased heading. Insert between `# Changelog` and `## 0.4.0`:

```markdown
## Unreleased

- **The case-auditor is live: a fifth skill, `case-audit`, and the `case-auditor` agent.** Checks a
  case read-only and says whether it is READY for a base power flow, an N-1 (its monitoring), a
  time step, an OPF and a SCOPF, with the case summary the agent presents (load, generation,
  headroom by fuel type, shunts, size). Eighteen checks as small pure functions over what one
  esapp read returns, each tested on hand-built cases with no PowerWorld; one AC solve in memory,
  no retry; the case file's sha256 before and after in `findings.json`; and a test that fails the
  build if the engine names a write or uses PowerWorld outside a four-call allowlist. Findings go
  to `./case-audit/<case>/`, which ignores itself in git.
- Two rule pages: `methods/ltc-regulation-checks.md` and
  `concepts/unloaded-ehv-stub-overvoltage.md`, with what a live probe of two public cases found
  (a regulated bus of 0 cannot be written through SimAuto; `BusVoltLimLow/High` read the limit
  group's band; generator coordinates live on the substation). A third,
  `concepts/grid-workshop-auto-pfw.md`, is the handoff for missing PFW models.
- `concepts/opf-preconditions.md`: measured on two public cases, a super area on OPF meets the
  area condition and makes its member areas redispatchable; a refused OPF does not raise through
  esapp (read `LPOPFSolutionStatus`); a zero marginal cost on wind and solar is a price, not
  missing data.
- Fixed: `methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md` listed an ISO label in `CustomString:2` as a
  TimeStep prerequisite (it is one pipeline's convention) and pointed at a page that does not
  exist; `methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md` glossed `XFAuto = NO` as "not an
  autotransformer" (it is the automatic-control switch).
- An eval suite for the case-auditor under `evals/` (`claude plugin eval`): two cases on live
  audits of the public Hawaii40 and Texas2k cases, six on seeded copies of Hawaii40 that test its
  judgment. Developer tools (the probe, snapshots, replays, fixtures) are in `tools/case-audit-dev/`,
  outside `skills/`.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Discovery, dist, commit**

Run: `claude --plugin-dir "$(pwd)" plugin details powerworld-hivemind`
Expected, in the inventory: `Skills (7)  case-audit, kb-page, knowledge-base-page, powerworld, powerworld-setup, schema-lookup, violation-map` and `Agents (2)  case-auditor, schema-librarian` (Claude Code 2.1.286 on the dry run).

Run: `claude plugin validate "$(pwd)"`
Expected: `✔ Validation passed`

Run: `python build_dist.py`
Expected: `Done. 56 pages across 4 directories; bundle carries 58 sections (pages + AGENTS.md + index.md).`

`git mv` already staged the move, so the old path is **not** named again (naming it makes `git add` fail with a pathspec error and stage nothing — critic b1, reproduced):

```bash
git add agents/case-auditor.md docs/agents/README.md skills/case-audit/tests/test_audit_agent.py README.md AGENTS.md GEMINI.md CHANGELOG.md dist/
git status --short
git commit -m "Ship the case-auditor agent: move the draft in, register it, rebuild dist"
```

Expected from `git status --short` before the commit: `R  docs/agents/case-auditor.md -> agents/case-auditor.md` among the staged lines, and nothing unstaged.

- [ ] **Step 7: First eval run (costs money — ask first)**

One run per case, no baseline arm, Sonnet as the agent, Haiku as the judge: eight short agent runs, estimated at a few US dollars; `--max-cost-usd 5` caps it. Say the estimate and get the go-ahead before running.

Run: `claude plugin eval . --trust-plugin --no-publish --ablation none --runs 1 --model sonnet --judge-model haiku --max-cost-usd 5 --json /tmp/case-auditor-eval.json`
Expected: exit 0 with every grader passing. This run is also the check on Task 16's three inferences. If `ran-the-case-auditor` fails while the others pass, open the run's trace in the report, read the `Agent` call's input, and set `input_match` to match the key and name as they appear there. If the agent says it cannot find the findings, read the `add_dirs` path from the trace and name it in the prompt body. If the content graders fail on a relay that shortened the subagent's answer, record it; do not loosen a grader to pass. Record the result either way; do not commit `evals/results/`.

Do not push.

## Open questions

1. **The overshoot size is unmeasured.** Neither public case has an online unit over its rating, so `base.gen_over_nameplate`'s max(1 %, 5 MW) stays a proposed default. And a fixed MW or percent of the unit's rating is the wrong axis: whether an overshoot changes a finding depends on the **branch margin** near where the extra MW flows (an overshoot of d MW moves nearby branches by up to about d MW, which matters on a branch at 98 % and not on one at 40 %). A threshold relative to the loading margin of the branches around the slack is the better rule; it needs a case with a real shortfall to calibrate.
2. **Partly priced OPF areas.** An OPF area with some priced and some unpriced movable units is Worth a look, listing the unpriced ones; only an area with no priced movable unit Stops. The OPF will dispatch the unpriced units somehow, and the kit has not measured how. Keep Worth a look?
3. **D8, not built:** a rule for a band copied from the tap range (`XFRegMin = XFTapMin`); the structure-only floating-stub FYI; `Gen.GenRegNum` pointing at nothing; an `n1` coverage profile.
4. **Fixtures in a public repo.** The Hawaii40 snapshot and weather-file header (tests) and the Hawaii40 and Texas2k findings (evals) are public synthetic data, but they are case data in the kit, with the file name only. Confirm that is acceptable.
5. **The eval sandbox's three inferences** (Task 16): the `Agent` call's input shape, where the `add_dirs` folder appears to the agent, and how closely the main session relays the subagent's answer. Task 17 Step 7 settles them for a few dollars.
6. **`mon.rate_set_empty` looks across all closed branches**, not per limit set, because the kit documents no branch-to-limit-set field. Right on single-limit-set cases (both public ones); coarse on cases with several.
7. **Coverage radius for a weather file:** 25 miles to the nearest station, a proposed default.
8. **Renewables are counted whatever their status**, weighted by `GenMWMax`. A unit offline in the case still counts toward "n of N follow the weather". Keep, or count online units only?
9. **Repeated profiles.** `--profiles timestep,timestep` is accepted and deduplicated silently. Keep, or refuse a repeat as a typo?
10. **Which coordinates TimeStep reads.** The bus pair is blank on both public cases and the substation pair is set; the engine accepts either. Which one TimeStep uses is not verified in the kit.
11. **Stray-server cleanup can catch a neighbour.** After a failed open the reader stops every `pwrworld.exe` that is new since the open began; another program starting PowerWorld in those same seconds would be stopped too. Acceptable, or should the cleanup only report the new PIDs?
12. **Super-area pooling is inferred.** For an area on OPF only through its super area, `opf.2` and `opf.3` are judged over the whole super area, so a load-only or unpriced member area is an FYI, not a Stop. That follows from the OPF moving units across the super area; it has not been measured on a case with such a member area.

## Revision record

### Revision 3 (2026-09-30)

A critic re-checked revision 2: 32 findings applied, 3 partly applied, and 8 new defects. All eight, and the three partial ones (the same defects), are fixed here and re-run in a fresh clone.

| change | why |
|---|---|
| `_tasklist()` returns `None` when it cannot list; `kill_new_servers` stops nothing and returns `None` if either listing is missing, and the error says so; a test with a failing first listing | an empty "before" made every running `pwrworld.exe` look new, and other jobs run PowerWorld on this machine |
| Each seeded eval case has well-formed bad answers that keep `## Verdict` and the right verdicts and fail exactly one grader; the plan says the regexes check format, escalation and fabrication, and only the `llm` grader judges | a verbatim copy of findings.md passed every regex in 7 of 8 cases, and every bad answer was stopped by `verdict-first` alone |
| The AST guard flags any `PowerWorld(...)` or `.esa` binding that is not a plain `name = ...`; `save` joins the substring list; five indirect bindings in the test | `with … as pw`, a tuple, a helper's return, `self.pw = …` and a conditional expression let `pw.save()` through |
| Areas on OPF only through a super area are pooled per super area for `opf.2` and `opf.3`; a thin member area is an FYI; two tests; open question 12 | a load-only or unpriced member area stopped the OPF although the OPF moves units across the super area |
| The default folder's `.gitignore` is written before anything else, including the error log | a failure wrote a traceback with the case's full path into an unignored folder |
| Every running test total re-computed task by task | Task 11 expected 108 where the total was 87 |
| "open question N" references re-checked against the final list | two pointed at the wrong question |
| The fixture path check searches every `findings.json` string and `findings.md` for `[A-Za-z]:[\\/]` or `/(Users\|home)/`; the Step 4 grep uses the same pattern | `match` missed paths inside a string, and the grep missed forward-slash drive paths |
| The brief gains "If findings.json says source is snapshot, the case was not opened: say so in the first line and give no read-only claim", with a test; seeded evals grade it | the brief never mentioned a replay |
| Two three-decimal voltages in the LTC page rounded; the `ts.pfw_missing` handoff says the copy it "writes" | scrub precision; `save` is now a forbidden substring |

### Revision 2 (2026-09-30)

Revision 1 was reviewed in series — architect (15 findings), then critic (sharpening the architect's fixes, where the critic's version won, and 12 new findings) — both REVISE. The coordinator's rulings R1–R7 are in the header. Every changed block was re-run in a fresh clone.

| change | why | found by |
|---|---|---|
| Condition 3 judged per OPF area: an area with no priced movable unit Stops (`where` = `AreaNum`); unpriced units beside priced ones are Worth a look | an unpriced area could read READY when another area was priced | architect #1, critic a1 |
| Priced = cost model and curve points; a zero `GenMCost` is no finding on a renewable, Probably on purpose on a thermal unit; kit page and brief cell updated | Hawaii40's nine "unpriced" units were exactly its wind and solar, and the OPF ran with them | critic b2, R4 |
| Snapshot flags removed from `audit.py`; `snapshot.py`, `replay.py`, `scrub_findings.py`, `make_fixture.py`, `probe.py` in `tools/case-audit-dev/`; replays stamped `source: snapshot`, `unchanged: null`, and a first line | a replay printed "unchanged: yes" and READY without opening a case; a snapshot is the whole case | architect #2 and #13, critic a2, R1 |
| Super areas settled live: an OPF ran with only Texas2k's super area on OPF and with Hawaii40's area on OPF inside an Off-AGC super area; a refusal returns a status string, not an exception. Members of a super area on OPF are OPF areas; recorded in `concepts/opf-preconditions.md` | `opf.1` returned early and guessed; the inverse case (Hawaii40) was untested too | architect #3, critic a3, R3 |
| AST guard: allowlist over esapp-bound names, bound-name tracking, substring scan kept, `test_only_reader_imports_esapp` | `pw.save()`, `pw[obj, f] = …`, `pw.pflow(method="DC")`, `pw.flat_start = True`, `pw.edit_mode()` all passed the old scan | architect #4, critic a4, R7 |
| `pockets` builds integer subtree sizes; far sides built on demand, capped, never crossing the bridge; the stub rule keeps the topmost **passing** bridge; memory test | the old side-set copy measured about 9.5 GB on the plan's own 20,000-bus test; a loaded attachment hid an unloaded sub-stub | architect #5, critic a5 |
| Evals: `Skill` dropped, dispatch grader pinned on `"subagent_type"`, fixture path in the prompt body, six seeded judgment cases, `not_contains` and line-count graders, the inferences named | copy-through passed every regex; `append_system_prompt` never reaches the subagent | architect #6, critic a6, R5 |
| Default `--out` is `./case-audit/<stem>/` with a `.gitignore` of `*`; variants by `Path.exists()` on computed names | output landed in the user's case folder; the glob listed it and over-matched | architect #7, critic a7, R2 |
| `opf_movable_headroom_mw` leaves out wind and solar | the test asserted 100 + 10 + 10 | architect #8 |
| A `scopf` verdict with `opf`; `mon.no_contingencies` (Stops, SCOPF only); brief, SKILL and agent test updated | SCOPF needs a contingency list the verdicts never checked | architect #9, critic a9 |
| Convergence decided on the raise; an unread tolerance is recorded, not failed; the summary is marked when the case did not solve | an unreadable tolerance turned every study NOT READY on the engine's account | architect #10 |
| Step-up = a unit on the LV bus (any status), no closed load, only transformers there; the skipped count asserted | an offline step-up was missed and a load-serving LTC with a small unit was exempted | architect #11, critic a11, b8 |
| `dc_skeleton` partial tier at 5 % (Worth a look, with the lines); "undefined" instead of "nan" | partial skeletons passed silently | architect #12 |
| `Finding.handoff`, required for `ts.pfw_missing` and `opf.3`, rendered as "What you need to get" | spec §4 asks for a fix pointer | architect #14 |
| `make_fixture` and `scrub_findings` remove every absolute path; the eval test scans every string; "Open questions" names no one; `Gen.Latitude:1` marked schema-known, behaviour-unverified | hygiene | architect #15, critic a15, b9 |
| Task 17 `git add` no longer names the moved-from path | it failed with a pathspec error and staged nothing | critic b1 |
| The brief's `dc_skeleton` row, `n1` line and a `scopf` line match the engine, with a test | the brief described a check the engine cannot make | critic b3 |
| `audit.py` imports only the standard library at module level; argparse errors and missing dependencies are three plain lines; the print is inside `try`; the SKILL covers any other exit | a missing dependency printed a traceback with exit 1 | critic b4 |
| CLI tests run the real `--case` path through a stand-in esapp, in process and as a subprocess | the reader path was never tested from outside the kit | critic b5, R1 |
| The cp1252 test writes into a non-ASCII folder and was checked to fail without the fix | it passed for the wrong reason | critic b6 |
| The weather reader is tested on the committed header of the public Hawaii40 file | it was tested only against its own writer | critic b7 |
| `GEN_OVER_MIN_MW` marked a proposed default; the overshoot `why` no longer blames the slack for every unit; open question 1 names branch margin | the brief is a spec, not a source | critic b10 |
| Rule pages: real-model specifics rounded to their order of magnitude | fingerprinting detail | critic b11 |
| A failed open stops only the `pwrworld.exe` PIDs that are new since it began | a failed open left the server running | critic b12, R6 |
| Review Focus #2 no longer cites a "tiny mismatch after a failed solve" | the re-run probe showed that mismatch was above the case's 1e-5 MVA tolerance | found while re-running the probe |

### Revision 1 (2026-09-30)

Written after a live probe and a full dry run in a scratch clone.

| finding | where it landed |
|---|---|
| A SimAuto write of `XFRegBus = 0` / `SSRegNum = 0` is silently refused; own-bus shunts read their own number | `reason = "zero"` is a defect (Task 8), rule page |
| `Gen.Latitude` blank on every public-case unit; `Gen.Latitude:1` (substation) set | `ts.latlon_missing` accepts the substation pair (Task 11); timestep page |
| `Branch.LineLength` is 0 on every branch | `base.dc_skeleton` drops the zero-length comparison (Task 7) |
| Both public cases hold stale `ViolationCTG` rows | expected in the Hawaii40 test and every fixture |
| esapp `Scale(LOAD, …)` changed nothing | the probe writes `LoadMW`/`LoadMVR` instead |
| The Hawaii40 weather file is VERSION 1 and still carries `META_STRINGS` | `pww.py` reads the field for both versions |
| pytest imports test modules by basename, so a second `test_docs.py` collides with schema-lookup's | every file here is `test_audit_*.py`; helpers in `auditcase.py` |

Not adopted: reusing `vmap.solve()` (its fallback resets generator setpoints and leaves DC mode); reading `PWCaseInformation` for the size counts (unverified in the kit, and the frames already give them); `Branch.LineLastRadial` / `Bus.RadialEnd*` (their open-branch and parallel-circuit handling is untested); a separate rule id for `ChkTaps = NO` (reported inside the LTC findings instead); `TeamOverbyeWeather` for the `.pww` header (a small reader keeps the engine free of it).
