# Power-system agents for PowerWorldHiveMind — design

Date: 2026-09-28. Status: design approved in conversation, awaiting review of this written spec.
Revised 2026-09-29 with the decisions from a review of the agent drafts.

## 1. Goal

Give anyone who installs PowerWorldHiveMind a small team of agents that audit a case, run
steady-state studies with the user's own preferences, map and compare the engineer's designs on
the full N-1, and answer "which object and field?" questions — so an open-ended request ("the bus is at 1.06, what fixes it?") is worked on
real numbers instead of guesses.

**Audience:** every user of the kit, including its author. Everything ships inside the kit and is
self-contained: no imports from any private research repository, worked examples and tests on
public synthetic grids only.

**Scope:** steady state only. Transient stability and GIC are out.

## 2. Design principles

1. **Methods are knowledge; agents are roles.** A study method (AC power flow, DC, N-1, OPF,
   SCOPF, time step) is a kit page plus an engine script. Adding a method never adds an agent.
2. **An agent exists only when a skill cannot do the job:** it needs a **fresh context** (output too
   noisy for the main session), **different permissions** (must never write the case), or
   **independence** (must not grade its own work).
3. **Deterministic checks live in code, not in prompts.** An agent reads findings and judges them;
   it does not re-derive a rule on each run.
4. **Judgment happens once, up front, where the user can see it.** Execution is mechanical and
   recorded, so the same request always reproduces the same numbers.
5. **Every PowerWorld write is read back.** PowerWorld reports success on writes that change
   nothing; a write that did not stick fails the run.
6. **Plain English in everything the engineer reads.** Every agent's and skill's Output format
   carries the kit's own short *Plain English* rule (see `docs/agents/`); internal sections stay
   technical.

## 3. The team

| role | kind | one-line job |
|---|---|---|
| engineer | the user + the main session with the `powerworld` skill | frames the problem, forms hypotheses, chooses candidates, decides |
| case-auditor | subagent, read-only | "is this case sane, and can it run study X?" |
| study-runner | subagent | turns preferences into settings, runs studies exactly, summarises |
| network-visualizer | subagent | maps the network around a site, measures the engineer's design and its own challengers on identical settings, and compares them side by side |
| schema-librarian | subagent, cheap model, read-only | "which object, field, command — and how sure?" |

There is no separate planner agent: power-system judgment belongs in the context the user is
talking to.

**Plan pictures — a main-session skill, not an agent** (`docs/agents/plan-pictures.md`). At every
approval gate — the runner's settings approval, the visualizer's challenger list, the supervisor's
next round, and a written plan before work starts — the plan is shown as a picture before the
approval question: a **swimlane** by default (lanes You / Agent / Script (fixed code, no AI) /
PowerWorld, numbered steps, safety checks drawn inline with "fails → stop + tell you"), and a
**flowchart** of what can stop the run as the second view. Data-flow and timeline views were
considered and rejected. **Hard rule:** the picture is generated from the plan file or manifest
the script actually runs, never from prose or the agent's summary, so it cannot show a step the
run will not take. Every gate names its file: the runner's settings approval draws from the
`steps` array in `manifest.json` (§5); the visualizer's challenger list from `challengers.json`,
same format (§6); the supervisor's next round from that round's `manifest.json`; a written plan
before work starts from the plan markdown file's numbered task list. It always writes a
**Mermaid** swimlane file (portable to GitHub, Obsidian, Codex, Gemini), plus a styled Claude page
for Claude Code users built from the same data. Each engineer can set their own default view per
gate in the kit's user config, as a `plan_pictures.default_view` map `{gate: swimlane|flowchart}`;
with no entry, the default is the swimlane.

**Portability:** subagents are a Claude Code feature. Every role is therefore a **skill plus an
engine** first; the skill carries the commands, and the agent file carries the **role contract**
(responsible / not responsible, protocol, failure modes, examples, checklist — revised 2026-09-28,
see `docs/agents/`). Codex and Gemini users of the kit get the skills and engines and lose only the
context isolation.

## 4. case-auditor

**Triggers:** "review this case", "scan the case", "can I run time step / OPF / N-1 on this",
"is this case ready for X".

**Engine** (`skills/case-audit/engine/`, esapp):
- `audit.py --case <pwb> --profiles base,timestep --out <dir>` → `findings.json` + `findings.md`.
- A **rule** is one small function: id, profile, severity (*Stops the study* / *Worth a look* / *FYI*), fields
  read, the check, a one-line why, the kit page that explains it, and a fix pointer — either a kit
  page or an external handoff.
- Findings carry the object's key fields so each points at exact objects.
- **Read-only, enforced by a test:** the engine may solve N-0 in memory but never calls
  `SaveCase` or writes a case. An AST test fails the build otherwise.

**v1 profiles** (every rule backed by a kit page; the pages for the four LTC, shunt and stub
rules are written in Plan 2, and those rules ship in v1):

| profile | checks |
|---|---|
| base | N-0 (AC) converges; not a DC-only skeleton (`dc_skeleton`); no unit above its rating after the solve (`gen_over_nameplate`); switched shunt or LTC regulating nothing or an out-of-service bus; LTC `XFRegTargetType = Middle`; LTC regulating its low-voltage side while its high side is out of band (`ltc_regulates_lv_side`); lightly loaded EHV radial stubs; holds no `ViolationCTG` rows from an earlier run (`stale_ctg_results`, FYI — do not read them) |
| monitoring (reported with base) | something is monitored (`mon.nothing_monitored`); the monitored footprint as the case holds it (`mon.footprint`); the normal and contingency rate sets in use carry ratings (`mon.rate_set_empty`); which rate sets carry values (`mon.rate_sets_populated`); buses with their own voltage limits (`mon.bus_limit_overrides`) |
| summary (every audit; facts, not findings) | load MW/Mvar; generation MW/Mvar and losses; headroom on online dispatchable units (wind/solar "weather-limited"); a fuel-type table keyed by the case's own `GenFuelType` code (units online/total, installed MW, output MW, share, headroom); online Mvar range; shunt count, Mvar now (`SSAMVR`), capacitive/inductive capacity (`SSMaxMVR`/`SSMinMVR`); size (buses, branches, transformers, areas, zones, kV levels). "Give me a summary" runs `base` and leads with these tables |
| timestep | renewables have `GenFuelType` WND/SUN, a PFW model string, valid Lat/Lon; for each wind unit missing a model, its wind class (`CustomInteger:1` 1–4 or `GenUnitType` W1–W4), because `Auto_PFW` silently skips a unit with neither; the `.pww` weather file given with the request covers the units (`ts.pww_footprint`) — no file given → an FYI line, not a blocker. TimeStep runs with any number of PFW models, so missing models, lat/lon and coverage **never stop it**. They are Worth a look, stated as what the run will do ("84 of 87 renewables will follow the weather; 3 read 0 MW, 410 MW, 1.4%: bus … unit …") |
| opf | an area on `BGAGC = "OPF"`; AGC-able gens; `GenCostModel` ≠ None with `GenCostCurvePoints > 0` and `GenMCost > 0` |

The weather file is an **input** given with the request. The auditor is a subagent: it returns,
it does not converse, so it cannot ask for the file mid-run.

Deferred: `n1` profile (with the runner's coverage guard), `transient` (out of scope).

**Handoffs for data the kit does not own.** The auditor detects; it never fabricates. Missing PFW
models link to the Grid-Workshop repository's `Auto_PFW` scripts (EIA-860 data the kit does not
carry), and the user re-audits the returned case — which catches units the insertion silently
skipped. Missing cost curves are reported as data to be sourced, never set to a default.

**Agent:** maps the question to profiles, runs the engine, triages each finding as *Broken /
Probably on purpose / Your call*, and returns **READY / NOT READY for <study>**, the blocker table
and the handoffs. The raw findings stay in the file.

## 5. study-runner

**Phase 1 — configure (agentic).** The user's request in plain words becomes an **option delta**
using the schema-librarian and `references/powerworld-study-options.md`, shown before anything
runs:

```
Sim_Solution_Options.MaxItr               100 → 200
CTG_Options.Include                       NO  → YES
Sim_Solution_Options.EvalSolutionIsland   NO  → YES   (required for island reporting)
```

A preference with no matching field is reported as such, with the nearest real field — never
improvised.

Configure ends by writing `manifest.json` with `"status": "awaiting approval"` — the delta, case
hash, commands, PowerWorld build, and a `steps` array,
`[{"n": 1, "lane": "You|Agent|Script|PowerWorld", "label": "...", "checks": ["..."]}]`, one entry
per step the run will take, in order, with the safety checks that guard it — and then stops. The
plan picture at this gate is drawn from that array.

**Who approves.** A subagent never receives the engineer's words directly. They arrive relayed by
the main session, and the harness marks relayed messages as coming from another agent. So the
approval record is the file: the **main session**, which hears the engineer, flips `status` to
`"approved"` (in `manifest.json` or `challengers.json`) on any clear go-ahead ("approved", "run it",
"go", "yes"). The agent runs only when the file says approved, and never judges approval by the
message's sender. Found in the 2026-09-29 runner trial, where a relayed "run it" was refused twice.

**Phase 2 — execute (deterministic).**
- On approval only `status` flips to `"approved"`; the same `manifest.json` runs unchanged.
  `manifest_hash` is computed over the whole manifest except `status`, so approval does not change
  it, and workers and replays ignore `status`.
- **Every worker replays the manifest itself.** Each parallel worker opens its own PowerWorld
  instance; an option set in the parent does not exist in the workers.
- Each option: read, write, read back, record before and after in `results/<run>/readback.json`
  (never in the manifest). A mismatch fails the run.
- The original case is never saved; variants run on fresh copies with their aux delta loaded and
  the case **solved after `LoadAux`** before anything is read.

**v1 methods:** AC power flow, DC power flow, N-1 contingency, OPF, SCOPF.

- **OPF and SCOPF need cost data** for the generators the study moves: real data in the case (the
  auditor's opf condition 3), or cost curves the engineer supplies themselves — even deliberately
  made-up ones, e.g. "flat $20/MWh". With the engineer's curves, every result is stamped "costs
  supplied by you, not from the case". Otherwise the runner refuses. It never invents costs and
  never switches a cost model on by itself. Area/super-area OPF control and `GenAGCAble` are
  switches the runner sets only for the areas and units the engineer approved.
- OPF: `InitializePrimalLP` then `SolvePrimalLP`, fail handler always given; results from
  `OPFSolutionSummary` (final cost is `LPOPFCostFunction:1`) and `Branch.LineLPUnenforceableMVA`.
- SCOPF: `SolveFullSCOPF(POWERFLOW|OPF)`; `SCOPFMaxOuterLoopItr` and the other `SCOPF*` options
  set through the configure phase like any other option. There is no inner-loop setting; a request
  for one is answered with `OPF_MaxLPIterations` as the nearest real field.
- **SCOPF ships in v1 without a dated end-to-end verification.** Every SCOPF result carries "not
  yet verified" until the first SCOPF run on a public case passes; that run is the verification,
  and its result is written back to `references/powerworld-study-options.md`.
- **DC OPF / DC SCOPF** use `SolvePowerFlow(DC)` to enter DC mode (never the `DCPFMode` flag alone)
  and `CTG_CalculationMethod = DC`; the AC re-solve guard applies afterwards.

**N-1 engine:** OS-process parallelism as described in `concepts/parallel-contingency-solve.md`,
re-implemented self-contained in the kit — contingency set split into chunks, one PowerWorld
instance per worker, `CTGSkip` partitioning, pure-Python merge. Serial or parallel is chosen by case
size (the fixed per-worker open cost dominates on small cases); worker count from CPU and RAM
headroom, not core count; every instance the runner opens is `.exit()`-ed.

**Monitoring default:** an N-1 monitors what the case's own setup monitors, unchanged, and every
result states it (e.g. "monitored: areas 1–3, 69 kV and up"). The runner never widens or narrows
it unless the engineer asks.

**Guards:**
- contingency coverage counted before a sweep (records vs lines plus two-winding transformers);
  `CTGAutoInsert` is not trusted without the count. A shorter list the engineer **chose** at
  configure (`contingency_set.source = "case list (engineer's choice)"`) runs, and every result is
  stamped "ran your list: <in_set> of <expected>; <n> not tested". The guard stops only a shortfall
  nobody chose, and it cannot be overridden after approval.
- DC only via `SolvePowerFlow(DC)`, followed by an AC re-solve before any AC result is read
- islands reported with all three checks — dropped (`LoadMW`/`GenMW`), energized
  (`CTG_Options.Include`), structural (`DetermineBranchesThatCreateIslands`) — gated on MW only
  when the pocket carries MW

**Post-processing:**
- violations from `ViolationCTG` with an explicit field list: thermal, voltage, unsolved, islands
- rankings both ways: worst outages, and most-hit elements (the kit's severity method)
- a reduced set (contingencies that produced a violation, plus an LODF near-miss screen) saved as
  aux for fast repeat runs — **never used for a verdict**. The near-miss loading threshold is a
  runner parameter, recorded in the manifest; its default is set in the implementation plan.

**Output:** `results/<run>/manifest.json`, `readback.json`, `scoreboard.csv`, `violations.csv`, `islands.csv`,
`rankings.csv`, `reduced_set.aux`, `REPORT.md`, and one status line to the engineer.

**Heartbeat (for run supervision, §8a).** While a run is live the engine rewrites
`results/<run>/heartbeat.json` at least once a minute: `state` (`running` / `finished` / `failed`),
contingencies done and total, ETA, failed chunks, unsolved so far, the count of `pwrworld.exe`
processes the run owns, and the time of the last completed solve. Written atomically (temp file,
then replace) so a reader never sees half a file. Watching a run means reading this file, never the
raw results.

## 6. network-visualizer

*Replaced the fix-reviewer on 2026-09-28.* A standalone reviewer grading AI-proposed fixes was the
awkward role; the useful one is the planner's question: *"here is my design — show me the network,
try it, try yours, and tell me which is better and why."*

**Triggers:** "visualize the network around …", "I want to connect this load / plant to that
substation — what happens?", "will it overload?", "compare my design with yours", "map the
violations".

1. **Map** with the existing `violation-map` engine, wrapped, not replaced. The opening view
   depends on case size (this reverses the 2026-09-28 focus-first rule):
   - a **light case** (under a bus-count cutoff) opens on the **whole case**, with the site
     highlighted, as an orientation view;
   - **zooming into a site** switches to that area **exclusively** — the rest is hidden, not just
     off-screen; boundary stubs stay for lines leaving it, and clicking a substation re-centres;
   - on a light case, a **"Back to whole case"** control returns from the zoomed area to the
     whole-case view;
   - a **"Render further network"** button grows the area by N more substation-hops per press;
   - a **heavy case** (over the cutoff, e.g. 100,000 buses) opens straight on the area view (the
     site plus the violation-map default (5 hops));
   - the **cutoff is measured in Plan 4**, by timing page build and render on public synthetic
     cases, and is a tunable bus-count default; the page states which mode it opened in and why;
   - what is drawn never limits what is computed: the N-1 stays full-system.
2. **Measure the engineer's design(s)** exactly as given: N-0, then the **full** N-1 through the
   study-runner engine with one settings manifest, and all three island checks.
3. **Propose challengers** only when asked, 1–3, cheapest first from the kit's action menu
   (setpoints and controls before new devices), each labelled as the agent's proposal. The list is
   written to `challengers.json`: a `designs` array,
   `[{"name": "...", "devices": "...", "changes": "what it changes, in plain words"}]`, next to a
   `steps` array in the runner manifest's format, whose measuring steps are labelled with those
   design names. The agent returns "awaiting approval" before measuring any challenger.
4. **Compare** every design on the same manifest in one scoreboard, and render a map with a
   Before / Engineer / Challenger switch.

**Guards (they carry what the reviewer existed for):**
- every design — the engineer's and the agent's — is measured on identical settings and the full
  contingency set; a design measured on fewer outages is never compared with one measured on all;
- the comparison is engine numbers only; the agent states **where the engineer's design wins**, and
  never declares a winner without the table;
- the agent never edits the engineer's design, and never saves over the original case.

**Engine work this needs** (none of it exists yet): **the size-based opening rule on every view**
(whole case under the cutoff, area view over it, exclusive zoom, "Back to whole case", "Render
further network", and the measured cutoff) — the radial-ties page today draws the whole grid
whatever its size; the voltage page's hop slider tops out at 6, which caps "Render further
network", so that maximum must be raised; a *large-load* candidate kind (today: shunt,
line, setpoint edit); the **thermal view** `violation-map` lists as not built; and full-N-1
measurement of candidates through the study-runner engine (today the voltage page measures listed
outages and the radial page bridge outages only).

## 7. schema-librarian

Answers "which object, field, command?" in a few lines, with a confidence tag.

- **Sources, in order:** `references/powerworld-study-options.md` (curated, provenance-tagged) →
  `references/powerworld-option-objects-v25.md` and `powerworld-object-fields-v25.xlsx` (exact
  fields, keys, required fields, writability) → `references/powerworld-study-commands.md` (syntax).
- **Answer shape:** object, key fields, required fields, the field(s), a write snippet, and one of
  *verified on a live case / documented / schema-only*.
- **Used by** the user directly and by the runner's configure phase.
- Never touches a case; never states a field name absent from the export.

## 8. Walkthrough: "a bus sits at 1.06 pu, what fixes it?"

1. Engineer forms hypotheses from the kit's pages (line charging on a stub, an LTC holding the
   wrong side, a capacitor left on, a generator setpoint).
2. case-auditor (base profile) returns the neighbourhood diagnosis. Nothing changes.
3. Engineer turns it into candidates, cheapest first (zero-device setpoint and control fixes before
   new devices).
4. study-runner measures each candidate on a copy — N-0, then an N-1 screen on the survivors, a
   screen that narrows the list and is never used for a final answer — and returns a scoreboard.
5. network-visualizer maps the neighbourhood and puts the engineer's pick beside its own
   challenger on the full N-1, same settings, with a Before / Engineer / Challenger switch.
6. Engineer decides from the side-by-side scoreboard.

## 8a. Run supervision — a mode, not an agent

Long runs — a full N-1 on a large case, a TimeStep year — take hours. Today the engineer starts one,
trusts it, and finds out the next day whether it finished. Run supervision lets the engineer
follow a run from anywhere and make each round's decision from a phone.

It is a **mode of the main session** (a skill, `run-supervisor`), not a subagent: a subagent lives
only while its parent task runs, so it cannot wait hours for a reply or reach a phone. The main
session can — it runs the study in the background, wakes on meaningful heartbeat changes plus one
stall timer rather than polling, sends push notifications, and can be opened from the Claude
mobile or web app through Remote Control.

1. **Launch** the study-runner engine in the background with an approved manifest.
2. **Watch** `heartbeat.json`. Wake only on a meaningful field change: `state` changes,
   `failed_chunks` grows, `unsolved` crosses its threshold, or `pwrworld_owned` exceeds
   workers + 1. Also run **one** stall timer that checks the age of `last_solve_at` (stall) and of
   `updated` (no heartbeat). Never a tight polling loop.
3. **Alarm** (push notification) on: no progress for N minutes (default 15), any failed chunk,
   an unsolved count above the manifest's threshold, more `pwrworld.exe` processes than workers
   (a leak), the run failing, and the run finishing.
4. **Round digest** when a round finishes: the scoreboard's headline, the worst offenders, islands,
   and two to four concrete next moves — e.g. "measure the three cheapest candidates on the worst
   corridor", "map the islanded pocket with the network-visualizer", "stop here".
5. **The engineer decides** from the phone. The answer is a choice among the offered moves or free
   text; nothing proceeds without it — no auto-approval, same as every other gate in this design.
6. The chosen move launches the next round (study-runner or network-visualizer) and supervision
   continues.

Portability: the engine and the heartbeat file are plain files any harness can read. Push
notifications, background watching and Remote Control are Claude Code features; other harnesses get
the heartbeat and the digest, not the phone.

## 10. Testing

All on public synthetic cases.

| test | passes when |
|---|---|
| auditor, clean case | READY for each profile the case supports |
| auditor, seeded defects (strip PFW from 3 units, zero a regulated bus, set a cost model to None) | reports exactly those, nothing new |
| auditor read-only | AST test finds no `SaveCase` / case write in the engine |
| runner, serial vs parallel | the same violation set and the same devices ranked; values agree within 1e-4 relative |
| runner, manifest replay | two runs of one manifest give the same violation set and the same devices ranked; values agree within 1e-4 relative |
| runner, read-back | a write that does not stick fails the run loudly |
| runner, coverage | an incomplete contingency set that nobody chose fails the guard; the same set chosen at configure runs, and every result is stamped "ran your list: n of N" |
| runner, OPF gate | on a case with no cost data, OPF and SCOPF are refused, not run |
| runner, user-supplied costs | an OPF run on cost curves the engineer supplied carries the stamp "costs supplied by you, not from the case" on every result |
| runner, OPF | on a case with cost data, OPF returns a solved status and a final cost, and binding lines match `LineLPUnenforceableMVA` |
| runner, SCOPF | converges within `SCOPFMaxOuterLoopItr`; changing that option changes the recorded loop count; result recorded as the dated verification |
| visualizer, parity | two designs measured in one comparison share one manifest hash and one contingency count |
| visualizer, side effects | a design that clears the target but creates a new overload shows the new overload in the scoreboard |
| runner, heartbeat | during a run the heartbeat advances; a killed worker shows up as a failed chunk within one heartbeat interval |
| supervisor, stall | a run whose `last_solve_at` stops advancing raises the stall alarm after the configured interval |
| supervisor, gate | the next round never launches without an engineer's answer |
| visualizer, large load | adding a load candidate changes N-0 flows and appears on the map's Before/Engineer switch |
| auditor, no weather file | a timestep audit with no `.pww` given reports an FYI line and does not block timestep on it |
| auditor, renewable gaps | 3 of 87 renewables without a PFW model → timestep READY, with a Worth-a-look line saying which units read 0 MW and their MW share; never NOT READY for missing models alone |
| runner, monitoring stated | every N-1 result states what was monitored |
| runner, SCOPF stamp | every SCOPF result is stamped "not yet verified" until the first public-case run passes |
| visualizer, opening mode | the map opens in the right mode for its bus count (whole case under the cutoff, area view over it) and says which |
| plan pictures, fidelity | at each gate — runner `manifest.json`, visualizer `challengers.json`, supervisor next round's `manifest.json`, a written plan's numbered task list — picture steps == file steps (none added, none missing, same order) |
| librarian | known lookups (shunt keys, island reporting, SCOPF outer loops, no SCOPF inner loop) answered correctly with the right confidence tag |

## 11. Build order

0. Prerequisites: sync the kit's `concepts/parallel-contingency-solve.md` (missing the rule to
   `.exit()` instances you own) and `methods/reading-violationctg.md` (still says islanding is
   undetectable).
0b. Before Plans 2–3 — kit pages the agent drafts found wrong or missing (gap audit, 2026-09-28):
   - **Contradictions to resolve:** `methods/adding-devices-esapp.md` calls bare
     `LPOPFCostFunction` the final cost, while `references/powerworld-study-options.md` says `:1` is
     final and bare is initial; the same page runs DC off the `DCApprox` flag, which
     `powerworld-study-options.md` says is not enough; the solver token is `POLARNEWTON` in
     `concepts/aux-only-powerworld.md` but `POLARNEWT` in `methods/handling-errors.md` and
     `concepts/lodf.md`; the coverage rule in `powerworld-study-options.md` ignores the autoinsert
     exclusions in `methods/new-device-contingency-aux.md`.
   - **Not a PowerWorld prerequisite:** `methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md` lists an ISO region in
     `CustomString:2` among TimeStep's per-unit prerequisites. It comes from one project's own
     shapefile join, not from PowerWorld; reword the page so it reads as that pipeline's
     convention.
   - **Monitoring footprint:** document how area, zone, kV and element monitoring settings combine
     and which area a tie line belongs to (today only `Area.BGReportLimits` is verified).
   - **Pages to write:** the PFW insertion tool; cost-model types, curve structure and the values
     `OPF_GenCostModel` / `OPF_PtsPerCurve` accept; OPF result fields (solve status, LMPs, detecting
     an infeasible solve); the `SuperArea.BGAGC` value list; when to call `CTGSetAsReference` after
     loading a variant; worse-end branch loading (`LinePercent:1`, `LSEndMonitor`); how monitoring
     and OPF treat zero-rated branches; `Limit_Monitoring_Options` defaults.
1. schema-librarian — smallest, reads pages that already exist, and the runner depends on it.
2. case-auditor — first writes the four rule pages (a switched shunt or LTC regulating a bus that
   does not exist or is out of service, `base.regulates_nothing`; an LTC with
   `XFRegTargetType = Middle`, `base.ltc_middle_target`; an LTC regulating its low-voltage side
   while its high side is out of band, `base.ltc_regulates_lv_side`; a lightly loaded EHV stub
   rising on its own line charging, `base.floating_stub`), then the base/timestep/opf profiles.
3. study-runner — ACPF, DCPF, N-1, then OPF and SCOPF (behind the auditor's opf gate).
4. network-visualizer — measure the opening cutoff, large-load candidate, thermal view, full-N-1 comparison through the study-runner engine.
5. run supervision — the `run-supervisor` mode over the runner's heartbeat; after Plan 3, because it
   supervises the runner's runs.
6. plan pictures — the `plan-pictures` skill; after the runner (Plan 3), because it draws from the
   plan files and manifests the runner writes.

## 12. Out of scope for v1

Transient stability, GIC, unit commitment, an n1 audit profile.

## 13. Open questions

- Which public synthetic cases serve as fixtures: one without PFW models or cost data, one with
  PFW models (the time-step demo's case), one with cost data if any public case carries it.
- Whether the kit may redistribute PowerWorld's field export and a digest of the aux-file-format
  document; this decides whether the librarian's sources ship or are fetched by the user.
- Does PowerWorld/SimAuto keep running with the PC locked, or the user logged out? Run supervision
  assumes the machine stays up for hours; test this before building Plan 5.
- ~~Plugin agent discovery~~ — answered 2026-09-28: `agents/` in the kit is loaded
  (`claude --plugin-dir <kit> plugin details powerworld-hivemind`, Claude Code 2.1.284).
