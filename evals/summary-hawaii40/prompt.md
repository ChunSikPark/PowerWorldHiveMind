description: Summary mode on a clean public case (live audit, path-scrubbed).
tags: [case-auditor]

append_system_prompt: "You are the main session of the PowerWorldHiveMind kit. When the user asks about a PowerWorld case's readiness, health or contents, hand the request to the case-auditor agent with the Agent tool: pass the user's words and the audit output below verbatim, add nothing. Then relay the agent's final message to the user verbatim, once, adding nothing before or after it."

Give me a summary of Hawaii40_base.pwb - what's in it, and is it sane?

PowerWorld isn't on this machine, but I already ran the case audit on it. Here is its findings.md:

# Case audit

Case checked: `Hawaii40_base.pwb`  
Audited: 2026-09-30T23:22:47  
Case file unchanged by the audit: yes

## Verdict
- base: READY
- n1: READY — monitoring only; the runner counts outage coverage

## What's in the case
| | MW | Mvar |
|---|---|---|
| Load | 1,136 | 0 |
| Generation (online) | 1,155 | 9 |
| Losses | 18 | |
| Headroom on online units (dispatchable) | 177 | |
| Online Mvar range | | -242 to 403 |

| fuel (as the case labels it) | units online / total | installed MW | output MW | share of output | headroom MW |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BIT (Bituminous Coal) | 0/1 | 180 | 0 | 0% | 0 |
| DFO (Distillate Fuel Oil) | 18/23 | 1,405 | 738 | 64% | 165 |
| OBL (Other Biomass Liquids) | 12/12 | 146 | 135 | 12% | 12 |
| SUN (Solar) | 6/6 | 167 | 156 | 13% | 0 (weather-limited) |
| WND (Wind) | 3/3 | 127 | 127 | 11% | 0 (weather-limited) |

| shunts | in service | Mvar now | capacitive capacity | inductive capacity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 31 | 32 | 0 |

Size: 37 buses, 89 branches (12 transformers), 1 areas, 1 zones; kV levels 69, 138.

N-1 will check: areas 1 (of 1), all kV, 89 branches / 37 buses (the case's own setup).

## Findings
| what's wrong | where (keys) | why it matters | stops the study? | Broken / Probably on purpose / Your call | rule | kit page |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| the case already holds 14 contingency violation rows from an earlier run | — | they describe whatever the case was when that run happened, not this audit - do not read them | FYI | Probably on purpose | base.stale_ctg_results | methods/reading-violationctg.md |
| an N-1 will check 1 of 1 areas, 89 branches and 37 buses | — | a clean N-1 result covers only this footprint, not the whole system | FYI | Probably on purpose | mon.footprint | field export (schema-only) |
| rate sets with values: A (89 branches), B (89 branches), C (89 branches) | — | shows which rating letters a limit set could point at | FYI | Probably on purpose | mon.rate_sets_populated | methods/reading-violationctg.md |

## Every object, per finding
