"""The only module that talks to PowerWorld. Opens the case, solves AC once in memory, reads
every field in casedata.READS, closes. Never writes: tests/test_audit_read_only.py enforces it.

One AC solve on the case as it opened - no retry, no flat start, no DC fallback - because the
verdict is about this case, and every fallback changes what is being measured (a flat start
resets generator voltage setpoints; a DC solve switches the case to DC mode).
