"""The case-auditor eval suite loads, its prompts carry their fixtures, its fixtures say where
they came from and carry no local path, and its regex graders pass a good answer and fail bad
ones. No model is called.

What the regexes check: format (a Verdict section, the three labels, no shorthand, no wall of
prose of twelve plain lines), escalation (READY where the study runs, NOT READY where it does
not), fabrication (no invented price) and copying (no `## Every object, per finding` and no
json block: only the engine writes those, so a pasted findings.md fails). Length is not capped:
the contract puts the case-summary tables in chat. Whether an answer describes this case is
judged only by the llm grader. So each good answer below is contract-faithful, with the summary
tables copied from its fixture, and each bad answer keeps the Verdict and the right verdicts and
breaks exactly one grader.
