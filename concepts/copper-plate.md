# Copper-Plate Model

## Abstract
Collapse the entire transmission network — strip all branches, loads, and shunts, then add a single slack bus — so generators dispatch to serve total system load **without any transmission constraints**. Every generator sees infinite capacity between itself and every other bus; hence "copper plate" (ideal conductor). Used in pfw copperplate to let weather-driven renewable output dispatch freely, isolating the weather → MW signal from network topology artifacts. The build sequence (delete Branch/Load/Shunt → add slack bus 999999 → large slack gen) is documented in pfw copperplate backend.

## Connections

- **Used in:** pfw copperplate (weather-driven renewable dispatch without network limits — see pfw copperplate backend for exact build steps)
- **💡 Could apply to (idea transfer):** renewable resource/potential assessment · max-generation studies · isolating a weather → MW signal from any network study
- **Across:** time step simulation (copper-plate runs are typically time-step simulations over a weather period)

### What it does and why

A full power-flow model enforces transmission constraints: a wind farm may be curtailed because a nearby line is at thermal limit, even if the wind is blowing. For studies that ask "how much energy could these generators produce given this weather?" — not "how much does the network allow?" — those constraints are noise. Copper-plate removes them.

With all branches deleted:
- No line flow limits to violate.
- No voltage constraints (no shunts, no reactive power coupling).
- Total generation = total load, balanced by the slack bus.
- Each generator dispatches to its weather-driven maximum (wind speed → MW, solar irradiance → MW).

The slack bus absorbs any imbalance (positive or negative), so the power balance always closes regardless of the renewable dispatch profile.

### Build steps (from pfw copperplate backend)

Starting from a full PowerWorld case:
1. **Delete Branch objects** — removes all transmission lines and transformers, eliminating all flow constraints.
2. **Delete Load objects** — removes all bus loads (load is represented as a net system-wide value, served by the slack).
3. **Delete Shunt objects** — removes all capacitors/reactors (no reactive power devices needed in a copper-plate model).
4. **Add slack bus 999999** — a synthetic bus that acts as the infinite balancing node.
5. **Add large slack generator at bus 999999** — set to AGC/slack mode with very large MW limits (e.g., ±99999 MW) so it can absorb any imbalance.

The result is a star topology: every original generator bus connects to the slack, and the slack sets system frequency/voltage reference.

### Use in pfw copperplate

The PowerFlow Weather (PFW) copper-plate model drives weather-dependent renewable generators (wind, solar) through a time-step simulation over a historical weather period. Because the network is gone, the MW output of each generator in each time step is determined purely by the weather at its location — wind speed for wind, GHI/DNI for solar. This isolates the **weather → MW** relationship and produces a clean time series of potential (unconstrained) renewable generation.

Downstream studies can then take this unconstrained generation signal and apply network constraints separately — a decomposition that keeps the weather modeling and the network modeling cleanly separated.

### 💡 Idea-transfer targets

- **Renewable resource/potential assessment:** "How much energy could all the wind and solar in a region produce over a 20-year climate?" Copper-plate gives you the unconstrained answer; the gap between copper-plate and network-constrained output quantifies curtailment potential.
- **Max-generation studies:** "What is the theoretical maximum MW this fleet could produce on any hour?" Strip the network, dispatch everything to maximum, read the total.
- **Weather → MW signal isolation for dynamic line rating:** DLR studies need to know how wind-driven generation affects line loading. A copper-plate pre-pass isolates the weather → generation relationship before layering in network effects.
- **Benchmarking network congestion:** the difference between copper-plate dispatch and constrained dispatch quantifies how much transmission is limiting renewable utilization — a useful metric for real power planning.

### What copper-plate does NOT give you

- **Voltage profiles** — no branches means no voltage drops, no reactive coupling.
- **Line loading** — by construction there are no lines.
- **Congestion signals** — the whole point is to remove them.
- **Locational marginal prices** — no network, no transmission component to the LMP.

If you need any of these, you need the full network model. Copper-plate is specifically for studies where the question is about energy potential, not delivery constraints.

### Relationship to time step simulation

Copper-plate models are almost always run as time-step simulations: the weather input changes each time step, the renewable dispatch updates, and the slack absorbs the balance. The time-step simulation framework in time step simulation is the computational engine; the copper-plate topology is the network configuration. They compose naturally.
