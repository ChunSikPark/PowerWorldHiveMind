# Reference: every PowerWorld option object and its fields (Simulator 25)

## Abstract

All 32 PowerWorld `*_Options` objects and their 1,079 fields, generated from the Simulator 25
field export. Use it to find the exact field behind any study setting. For which fields matter per
study, whether each is verified, and the traps, read [powerworld-study-options](powerworld-study-options.md) first.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Hub:** [powerworld-study-options](powerworld-study-options.md) (curated: which option to change for which study, provenance-tagged)
- **Across:** [powerworld-study-commands](powerworld-study-commands.md) (the SCRIPT commands that run each study) · [esapp-schema-reference](esapp-schema-reference.md) (key fields for non-option objects)

## Content

Generated 2026-09-28 from `powerworld-object-fields-v25.xlsx` (in this folder), the PowerWorld
Simulator 25 (beta) field export dated 2026-09-12. **Nothing here is hand-written: the descriptions
are PowerWorld's.** Regenerate on a new Simulator build rather than editing rows.

- Per-object boilerplate fields (custom expressions, calculated fields, data checks, `ObjectID`,
  `Selected`) are omitted.
- **enterable**: `Yes` = writable by `SetData`; `AUX/Paste` = writable only from an aux file or a
  paste; `read-only` = cannot be written.
- A `:N` suffix is a distinct field (`MaxItr:1` is not `MaxItr`). **concise** is a second name for
  the same field; the aux parser accepts either.
- Set a field with `SetData(<object>, [field], [value]);` (esapp: `pw.esa.SetData(...)`), then
  **read it back**: a write that changes nothing still reports success.
- Grouped by study area. Transient and GIC come last and are outside steady-state work.
