# Case impedance completeness — a case that solves in DC may carry no R and no B at all

## Abstract

A PowerWorld case can solve DC power flow perfectly, report sensible flows, and be handed
between projects for years while carrying **no resistance and no line charging whatsoever**.
DC power flow reads only `X`, so nothing in a DC pipeline ever touches `R` or `C` and nothing
complains. The Synth9k 2031 case had `LineR ≤ 1e-6` and `LineC == 0` on **97.2% of its closed
lines** — undetected because every consumer up to that point was DC. **Check X/R before
trusting any case you did not build**, and especially before promising anyone an AC study.

## Connections

- **Up:** Cross cutting MOC
- **Used in:** real power planning — found in the Synth9k 2031 case, 2026-08-18 ·
  dispatch — independently confirmed on a second lineage 2026-08-18: `LineR <= 1e-6`
  and `LineC == 0` on **97.5%** of `Synth9k_case` and
  **100.0%** of `Synth8k_draft` (median X/R 100,010 and 113,465), so the five
  scenario cases built from them in [applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case](../methods/applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case.md) inherit it
- **💡 Could-apply-to:** reactive power planning (its input is exactly such a case) ·
  synthetic creation (case handoff between build stages is where this is introduced) ·
  identify differences (a diff that ignores R/C will not see it) · grid statistics ·
  any project that receives a `.pwb` from another project or vintage
- **Across:** derive by ratio (a ratio on a placeholder zero stays zero — check this
  first) · artifact level validation (same family: the artifact exists, but is it real?)

## Content

### The check

One line, and it is decisive:

```python
xr = (br.LineX / br.LineR.replace(0, np.nan)).median()      # closed, non-transformer lines
```

| median X/R | verdict |
|---|---|
| **2 – 20** | normal overhead transmission |
| **> 1000** | R is placeholder. The case cannot do losses, and AC will not mean anything. |
| **74,195** | what the Synth9k 2031 case actually measured |

Alongside it, count `LineC == 0`. Legitimate zeros exist — genuine intra-substation bus ties,
3,474 of them in this case — so compare the count against the number of zero-length branches
rather than expecting zero.

### Why it survives so long

**DC power flow reads only `X`.** Losses, charging, voltage and reactive power are the only
things that read `R` and `B`, and none of them appear in a DC pipeline. So a case can pass
through case-building, dispatch, DC screening and a conductor-planning loop with two-thirds of
its impedance missing, and every stage reports success.

The failure surfaces only when someone finally runs AC — typically a different person, in a
different project, months later, who then debugs *their* code.

### The trap inside the trap

A conductor-resizing or reinforcement loop **does not fix this**, even though it writes
impedance. It only writes R/X/C on the lines it upgrades — 335 of 11,888 in the Aug-13
Synth9k run, 2.8%. Running it and declaring the case AC-ready is exactly wrong: you get a case
that is 97% DC-skeleton and 3% real, with **no way to tell the two apart** by inspection.

### The fix is usually a restore, not a model

Do not model R and B back in if they exist somewhere. In this case the same 13,470 branch keys
had healthy impedance in an older vintage of the same network, whose `X` agreed with the
current case on **96.2%** of lines — so the repair was a keyed copy of R and C, not a
reconstruction. Median X/R went 74,195 → 5.40.

Checklist for a restore:
1. **Key on the real key fields** (`BusNum`, `BusNum:1`, `LineCircuit` as a *stripped string* —
   see [per-unit-basis-discipline](per-unit-basis-discipline.md)'s cousin trap, a CSV round-trip turns `'01'` into `1`).
2. **Assert zero unmatched rows on both sides.** A partial join silently leaves placeholders.
3. **Check the donor's `X` agrees** with the target's. If it does not, you are transplanting
   R and C onto a different network's reactance — count and list those lines rather than
   hiding them (448 of 11,888 here).
4. **Prefer a donor untouched by known-buggy code.** 352 lines in the chosen donor carried R/C
   written by a defective recomputation and were sourced from its pre-upgrade ancestor instead.

### Do not confuse "solves" with "is physical"

The 2031 case solved DC fine throughout. Convergence is not evidence of a complete model — it
is evidence that the subset of the model your solver reads is self-consistent.

# Copper-Plate Model

## Abstract
Collapse the entire transmission network — strip all branches, loads, and shunts, then add a single slack bus — so generators dispatch to serve total system load **without any transmission constraints**. Every generator sees infinite capacity between itself and every other bus; hence "copper plate" (ideal conductor). Used in pfw copperplate to let weather-driven renewable output dispatch freely, isolating the weather → MW signal from network topology artifacts. The build sequence (delete Branch/Load/Shunt → add slack bus 999999 → large slack gen) is documented in pfw copperplate backend.

## Connections
- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Used in:** pfw copperplate (weather-driven renewable dispatch without network limits — see pfw copperplate backend for exact build steps)
- **💡 Could apply to (idea transfer):** renewable resource/potential assessment · max-generation studies · isolating a weather → MW signal from any network study
- **Across:** time step simulation (copper-plate runs are typically time-step simulations over a weather period)

## Content

### What it does and why

A full power-flow model enforces transmission constraints: a wind farm may be curtailed because a nearby line is at thermal limit, even if the wind is blowing. For studies that ask "how much energy could these generators produce given this weather?" — not "how much does the network allow?" — those constraints are noise. Copper-plate removes them.

With all branches deleted:
- No line flow limits to violate.
- No voltage constraints (no shunts, no reactive power coupling).
- Total generation = total load, balanced by the slack bus.
- Each generator dispatches to its weather-driven maximum (wind speed → MW, solar irradiance → MW).

The slack bus absorbs any imbalance (positive or negative), so the power balance always closes regardless of the renewable dispatch profile.

### Build steps (from pfw copperplate backend)

Starting from a full PowerWorld case:
1. **Delete Branch objects** — removes all transmission lines and transformers, eliminating all flow constraints.
2. **Delete Load objects** — removes all bus loads (load is represented as a net system-wide value, served by the slack).
3. **Delete Shunt objects** — removes all capacitors/reactors (no reactive power devices needed in a copper-plate model).
4. **Add slack bus 999999** — a synthetic bus that acts as the infinite balancing node.
5. **Add large slack generator at bus 999999** — set to AGC/slack mode with very large MW limits (e.g., ±99999 MW) so it can absorb any imbalance.

The result is a star topology: every original generator bus connects to the slack, and the slack sets system frequency/voltage reference.

### Use in pfw copperplate

The PowerFlow Weather (PFW) copper-plate model drives weather-dependent renewable generators (wind, solar) through a time-step simulation over a historical weather period. Because the network is gone, the MW output of each generator in each time step is determined purely by the weather at its location — wind speed for wind, GHI/DNI for solar. This isolates the **weather → MW** relationship and produces a clean time series of potential (unconstrained) renewable generation.

Downstream studies can then take this unconstrained generation signal and apply network constraints separately — a decomposition that keeps the weather modeling and the network modeling cleanly separated.

### 💡 Idea-transfer targets

- **Renewable resource/potential assessment:** "How much energy could all the wind and solar in a region produce over a 20-year climate?" Copper-plate gives you the unconstrained answer; the gap between copper-plate and network-constrained output quantifies curtailment potential.
- **Max-generation studies:** "What is the theoretical maximum MW this fleet could produce on any hour?" Strip the network, dispatch everything to maximum, read the total.
- **Weather → MW signal isolation for dynamic line rating:** DLR studies need to know how wind-driven generation affects line loading. A copper-plate pre-pass isolates the weather → generation relationship before layering in network effects.
- **Benchmarking network congestion:** the difference between copper-plate dispatch and constrained dispatch quantifies how much transmission is limiting renewable utilization — a useful metric for real power planning.

### What copper-plate does NOT give you

- **Voltage profiles** — no branches means no voltage drops, no reactive coupling.
- **Line loading** — by construction there are no lines.
- **Congestion signals** — the whole point is to remove them.
- **Locational marginal prices** — no network, no transmission component to the LMP.

If you need any of these, you need the full network model. Copper-plate is specifically for studies where the question is about energy potential, not delivery constraints.

### Relationship to time step simulation

Copper-plate models are almost always run as time-step simulations: the weather input changes each time step, the renewable dispatch updates, and the slack absorbs the balance. The time-step simulation framework in time step simulation is the computational engine; the copper-plate topology is the network configuration. They compose naturally.

# Concept: The esapp environment

## Abstract

What `esapp` is, what it needs to run, and how its pieces fit together. `esapp` (ESA++)
is a Pythonic wrapper over PowerWorld Simulator's SimAuto COM server: a `PowerWorld`
entry point, a bracket interface that returns pandas DataFrames, and a `SAW` wrapper
exposing the raw SimAuto surface underneath. Read this once when setting up; read
[esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md) to actually drive a case.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [esapp](esapp.md) · [powerworld-simauto](powerworld-simauto.md) · [preflight-powerworld](../methods/preflight-powerworld.md) · [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md)
- **Deeper:** [esapp-package-backend](../references/esapp-package-backend.md) · [esapp-schema-reference](../references/esapp-schema-reference.md)

### Install

```bash
pip install esapp
```

Pulls in `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `geopandas`, and `pywin32`. The last
one is the COM bridge and is why this is Windows-only.

Before writing anything, run [preflight-powerworld](../methods/preflight-powerworld.md). It takes five seconds and
distinguishes "my code is wrong" from "this machine cannot run PowerWorld at all",
which are very different problems.

### What you actually need

| Requirement | Why | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | SimAuto is a COM server with no cross-platform equivalent | The weather half of this kit still works — see [teamoverbyeweather-client](../methods/teamoverbyeweather-client.md) |
| PowerWorld Simulator, installed | esapp drives it; it does not reimplement it | Nothing in the PowerWorld half functions |
| **The SimAuto add-on, licensed** | Automation is licensed separately from Simulator itself | Simulator's GUI works fine and every script fails. See [preflight-powerworld](../methods/preflight-powerworld.md) |
| Matching bitness | A 32-bit Simulator will not serve a 64-bit Python | `Class not registered` at dispatch time |

The licensing point is the one that surprises people. A perfectly good Simulator
installation can be completely unable to run a single line of automation, and nothing in
the GUI hints at it.

### Contributing to esapp

`esapp` is open source (Apache-2.0) and developed at Texas A&M:
**https://github.com/lukelowry/ESApp**

Found a bug, a missing field, or an undocumented behaviour while using this knowledge
base? Two places to send it: a defect in the **package** goes to the esapp repository
above; a defect in a **page** here goes to this repository's issues. They are different
problems with different fixes.

### Prefer `esapp` over `esa`

There is an older standalone `esa` package wrapping the same SimAuto server. Both work;
`esapp` is better documented and is what this kit's pages assume. Mixing them in one
project buys nothing and creates two mental models of the same COM object.

### The three layers

```
your code
    |
    v
PowerWorld          <- the entry point; open a case, get a summary
    |
    v
Indexable           <- the bracket interface: pw[Bus, "BusPUVolt"] -> DataFrame
    |
    v
SAW                 <- the SimAuto wrapper; RunScriptCommand and friends
    |
    v
pwrworld.SimulatorAuto   <- the COM server, i.e. PowerWorld itself
```

Most work happens in the bracket interface. Drop to `SAW` when you need a SCRIPT action
that has no bracket equivalent — see [aux-script-commands](../references/aux-script-commands.md) for the catalogue. Drop
below that essentially never.

### Use the high-level helpers before reaching for script commands

`PowerWorld` exposes worked-out helpers for the things people actually do. Verified
against esapp 0.1.3 by calling them:

```python
pw.pflow(getvolts=True, method="POLARNEWT")   # solve
pw.mismatch(asComplex=False)                  # per-bus P and Q mismatch
pw.overloads(threshold=100.0)                 # branches above a % of rating
pw.violations(v_min=0.9, v_max=1.1)           # limit violations
pw.flows()                                    # branch flows
pw.lodf((frm, to, ckt), method="DC")          # line outage distribution factors
pw.ptdf(seller, buyer, method="DC")           # transfer distribution factors
pw.ybus(dense=False)                          # admittance matrix (scipy sparse)
pw.jacobian(dense=False, form="R")            # the Jacobian
pw.gens(); pw.lines(); pw.loads()             # convenience tables
pw.voltage(complex=True, pu=True)
pw.save(filename=None)                        # write the case back
pw.snapshot()                                 # restore point
pw.run_mode(); pw.edit_mode()                 # switch modes
```

**Every one of these is a method — call it.** Referencing `pw.overloads` or `pw.flows`
without parentheses hands you a bound method where you expected a DataFrame, and the
failure surfaces somewhere further down looking like something else entirely.

Solver settings are the opposite: they are **assignable options**, not methods.

```python
pw.dc_mode = True          # NOT pw.dc_mode(True) -> TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable
pw.flat_start = True
pw.max_iterations = 50
pw.enforce_gen_mw_limits = True
```

Reach for a raw SCRIPT action only when no helper covers what you need.

### Getting at SimAuto directly

When you do need a raw SCRIPT action, the SimAuto wrapper is on the `.esa` attribute,
**not** on `PowerWorld` itself:

```python
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand('SolvePowerFlow(RECTNEWT)')
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(r'SaveCase("C:\out\case.pwb", PWB, YES)')
```

`pw.RunScriptCommand(...)` raises `AttributeError`. This is the single most common
first-attempt mistake with esapp, because every PowerWorld example you will find online
is written against the SAW object directly.

See [aux-script-commands](../references/aux-script-commands.md) for which action to use.

### Components and schema

Object types are importable classes rather than magic strings:

```python
from esapp.components import Bus, Gen, Load, Branch, Shunt, Area, Zone
```

The component schema is generated from PowerWorld's own field definitions, so field
names track Simulator rather than being hand-maintained. The full field map lives in
[esapp-schema-reference](../references/esapp-schema-reference.md).

### The rule that silently ruins writes

**Always keep an object's key fields in any DataFrame you write back.** For a generator
that is `BusNum` plus `GenID`; for a branch it includes the circuit identifier. Without
the key fields PowerWorld cannot tell which row you mean, and the write does not error —
it simply does nothing.

A second, related trap: `pw[Obj, field] = values` is **positional over the entire
table**. Assigning to a filtered subset writes nothing at all, silently. See
[applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case](../methods/applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case.md).

These two are responsible for more wasted debugging than every other esapp behaviour
combined, because both fail without raising.

### Snapshots

`snapshot()` gives you a restore point for safe experimentation, which is much cheaper
than reloading a large case between scenarios. PowerWorld's own `StoreState` /
`RestoreState` script actions do the same at the solver level.

### Verifying your setup

```python
from esapp import PowerWorld

pw = PowerWorld(r"C:\path\to\case.pwb")
print(pw.summary())    # n_bus, n_branch, n_gen, n_load, totals, v_min, v_max, sbase
```

If that prints a sensible dictionary, the environment is good and you can start at
[esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md).

# ESA++ (esapp) — tool reference

## Abstract

`esapp` (ESA++) is a Python toolkit that gives a Pythonic, pandas-flavored interface to PowerWorld Simulator's Automation Server (SimAuto) over COM. It is Windows-only and requires PowerWorld locally. This page is the full API map: top-level imports, architecture (mixin-built `SAW`, `PowerWorld` workbench, embedded modules), the bracket read/write interface, all `pw.*` methods, transient-stability helpers, and the GObject schema accessors. For how to drive it in practice, start at [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md).

## Top-level imports

```python
from esapp import PowerWorld          # main entry point
from esapp import SAW                 # low-level SimAuto wrapper (usually via pw.esa)
from esapp import TS, TSField         # transient-stability field constants
from esapp.components import Bus, Gen, Load, Branch, Shunt, Area, Zone  # GObject types
from esapp.utils import TSWatch, ContingencyBuilder, SimAction, BranchType  # helpers
```

`esapp/__init__.py` exports `PowerWorld`, `SAW`, `TS`, `TSField`, and the
exception hierarchy (`PowerWorldError`, `COMError`, `SimAutoFeatureError`,
`PowerWorldPrerequisiteError`, `PowerWorldAddonError`). `CommandNotRespectedError` was
**removed in 0.2.0** — do not reference it.
Note: `TSWatch` / `ContingencyBuilder` are **not** top-level — import them from
`esapp.utils`.

## Architecture (real)

- **`PowerWorld`** — `esapp/workbench.py`. The user-facing class; subclass of
  `Indexable`. Holds the live SimAuto connection on `pw.esa` and three embedded
  application modules: `pw.network`, `pw.gic`, `pw.buscat`.
- **`Indexable`** — `esapp/indexable.py`. Implements the bracket read/write
  interface (`__getitem__` / `__setitem__`) and `open()`.
- **`SAW` (SimAuto Wrapper)** — `esapp/saw/saw.py`. Built by the **mixin
  pattern** from `SAWBase` (`saw/base.py`) plus ~20 focused mixins:
  `DataMixin`, `PowerflowMixin`, `MatrixMixin`, `ContingencyMixin`,
  `TransientMixin`, `SensitivityMixin`, `GICMixin`, `OPFMixin`, `PVMixin`,
  `QVMixin`, `ATCMixin`, `FaultMixin`, `TopologyMixin`, `RegionsMixin`,
  `ModifyMixin`, `GeneralMixin`, `CaseActionsMixin`, `ScheduledActionsMixin`,
  `TimeStepMixin`, `WeatherMixin`. This is the raw COM layer — reach it via
  `pw.esa`.
- **Components** — `esapp/components/`. `grid.py` (auto-generated, large) holds
  a `GObject` subclass per PowerWorld object type; `ts_fields.py` holds the
  `TS` / `TSField` constants; `gobject.py` is the base class;
  `generate_components.py` regenerates both from the `PWRaw` TSV schema. **Do
  not hand-edit `grid.py` / `ts_fields.py` — regenerate them.**
- **Utils** — `esapp/utils/`: `network.py` (`Network`), `gic.py` (`GIC`),
  `dynamics.py` (`TSWatch`, TS result processing), `contingency.py`
  (`ContingencyBuilder`, `SimAction`), `b3d.py` (`B3D` field-file I/O),
  `buscat.py` (`BusCat`).
- **Enums / descriptors / exceptions** — `saw/_enums.py` (`SolverMethod`,
  `JacobianForm`, `LinearMethod`, `PowerWorldMode`, filter keywords, …),
  `_descriptors.py` (`SolverOption`, `GICOption` descriptors), and
  `saw/_exceptions.py` (`PowerWorldError` hierarchy).

## Bracket data interface (the core idiom)

```python
pw[Bus]                              # primary-key columns only
pw[Bus, "BusPUVolt"]                 # keys + one field
pw[Gen, ["GenMW", "GenMVR", "GenStatus"]]   # keys + several
pw[Bus, :]                           # keys + EVERY defined field
```

Reads go through `esa.GetParamsRectTyped` and return a typed `DataFrame`.
Writes use the same brackets:

```python
pw[Gen, "GenMW"] = 100.0             # broadcast scalar to existing gens
pw[Gen, "GenMW"] = [100, 150, 200]   # per-element list
pw[Bus] = df                         # bulk update from a DataFrame (must carry primary keys)
```

`pw[Type] = df` can also **create** objects when the case is in EDIT mode and
the SAW was opened with `CreateIfNotFound=True`.

> ⚠️ **Changed in 0.2.1.** Unknown and read-only columns used to raise
> `ValueError: Cannot set read-only field(s)` (`indexable.py:228`/`:280` in 0.1.x). They
> now emit a `warnings.warn` and the write is **still attempted** — PowerWorld is treated
> as the authority so a lagging generated schema can't block a newer Simulator's fields.
> The cost: a field-name typo no longer raises. Run write-heavy code under
> `python -W error::UserWarning`. See esapp script command wrappers.

> ⚠️ **Key fields are mandatory for writes.** PowerWorld matches each row back to an
> object by its **key field(s)** (e.g. `BusNum`+`GenID` for a Gen). The bracket read
> includes the keys automatically, so a read-modify-write round-trip keeps them — but if
> you build a DataFrame by hand, or drop columns, it **must still carry the key columns**
> or the write silently does nothing (no error, no change applied). On the raw `esa`/SAW
> path you must prepend them yourself: `pw.esa.get_key_field_list('gen') + [<fields>]`. Rule

## PowerWorld API surface (`pw.*`, from workbench.py)

- **State / case** — `pw.open()`, `pw.save(filename=None)`, `pw.close()`,
  `pw.edit_mode()`, `pw.run_mode()`, `pw.flatstart()`, `pw.snapshot()`
  (context manager: `SaveState` on enter, `LoadState` on exit),
  `pw.log(msg)`, `pw.print_log(...)`.
- **Solve** — `pw.pflow(getvolts=True, method=SolverMethod.POLARNEWT)` returns a
  complex voltage Series; `pw.ts_solve(ctgs, fields)` runs transient stability
  and returns `(metadata, timeseries)` DataFrames.
- **Voltages / power** — `pw.voltage(complex=True, pu=True)`,
  `pw.set_voltages(V)`, `pw.mismatch(asComplex=False)`, `pw.netinj(...)`,
  `pw.violations(v_min=0.9, v_max=1.1)`.
- **Matrices / topology** — `pw.ybus(dense=False)`,
  `pw.jacobian(dense=False, form=JacobianForm.RECTANGULAR, ids=False)`,
  `pw.busmap()`, `pw.buscoords(astuple=True)` (returns a `(Longitude,
  Latitude)` tuple by default — **not** a DataFrame).
- **Convenience tables** — `pw.gens()`, `pw.loads()`, `pw.shunts()`,
  `pw.lines()`, `pw.transformers()`, `pw.areas()`, `pw.zones()`,
  `pw.flows()`, `pw.overloads(threshold=100.0)`.
- **Sensitivities** — `pw.ptdf(seller, buyer, method=LinearMethod.DC)`,
  `pw.lodf(branch, method=LinearMethod.DC)`.
- **Quick props** — `pw.n_bus`, `pw.n_branch`, `pw.n_gen`, `pw.sbase`,
  `pw.summary()` (dict of counts + totals + v_min/v_max).
- **Solver options as descriptors** — set them like attributes:
  `pw.flat_start = True`, `pw.max_iterations = 30`, `pw.convergence_tol = 1e-4`,
  `pw.dc_mode = True`, … (each is a `SolverOption` mapping to a PowerWorld
  Sim_Solution_Options field).

## Embedded modules

- **`pw.network`** (`utils/network.py`) — `incidence()`, `laplacian(weights,
  ...)`, `lengths()`, `zmag()`, `ybranch()`, `yshunt()`, `gamma()`, `delay()`,
  `busmap()`, `buscoords()`; `BranchType.{LENGTH, RES_DIST, DELAY}` weighting.

```python
from esapp.utils import TSWatch, ContingencyBuilder
tsw = TSWatch().watch(Gen, [TS.Gen.P, TS.Gen.W])
fields = tsw.prepare(pw)
ctg = ContingencyBuilder("GenTrip", runtime=5.0).at(1.0).fault_bus("101").at(1.1).clear_fault("101")
meta, data = pw.ts_solve("GenTrip", fields)
```

`TSWatch` registers result fields; `ContingencyBuilder` fluently builds transient-stability
event sequences (`SimAction` enum). For dynamics studies only — see [powerworld-simauto](powerworld-simauto.md)
for the underlying `TransientMixin`.

# Concept: GIC — geomagnetically induced current

## Abstract

Geomagnetically induced currents are quasi-DC currents driven into the grid during a
geomagnetic disturbance, flowing through long transmission lines and transformer
neutrals. They cause half-cycle transformer saturation, harmonics, reactive-power
absorption, and in severe cases thermal damage. PowerWorld models GIC natively, and
`esapp` exposes it through `esapp.utils.GIC`. Verified against esapp 0.1.3.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [esapp](esapp.md) · [powerworld-simauto](powerworld-simauto.md) · [glossary](glossary.md)
- **Deeper:** [aux-script-commands](../references/aux-script-commands.md) for the underlying `GIC*` SCRIPT actions

## Content

### The physics, briefly

A changing geomagnetic field induces a geoelectric field at the earth's surface. That
field drives quasi-DC current through any long conductor grounded at both ends — which
describes a transmission line with grounded-wye transformers at each end.

The current is quasi-DC relative to 60 Hz, so it biases the transformer core into
half-cycle saturation. Consequences, in the order they usually matter:

- **Reactive power absorption** rises sharply, depressing voltage
- **Harmonics** appear and can trip protective relays
- **Transformer heating**, which is the damage mechanism in a severe storm

### The API, and the mistake to avoid

**There is no `pw.gic`.** GIC lives in `esapp.utils` as a class you construct with the
`PowerWorld` object:

```python
from esapp import PowerWorld
from esapp.utils import GIC

pw = PowerWorld(r"C:\path\to\case.pwb")
g = GIC(pw)
```

Then:

```python
g.configure(pf_include=True, ts_include=False, calc_mode="SnapShot")
g.storm(maxfield=100.0, direction=90.0, solvepf=True)   # V/km, degrees
g.model()                                               # build the GIC model
G = g.gmatrix(sparse=True)                              # conductance matrix
```

Verified signatures:

| Call | Signature |
|---|---|
| `GIC(pw)` | `__init__(self, pw=None)` |
| `configure` | `(pf_include: bool = True, ts_include: bool = False, calc_mode: str = 'SnapShot') -> None` |
| `storm` | `(maxfield: float, direction: float, solvepf: bool = True) -> None` |
| `model` | `() -> GIC` |
| `gmatrix` | `(sparse: bool = True) -> csr_matrix | ndarray` |

### Other settings on the object

The `GIC` object exposes the modelling knobs as attributes rather than arguments:

| Attribute | Controls |
|---|---|
| `efield_mag`, `efield_angle` | The geoelectric field magnitude and direction |
| `min_kv` | Voltage floor below which branches are excluded |
| `skip_low_r_lines`, `skip_equiv_lines` | Exclude low-resistance or equivalenced branches |
| `segment_length_km` | Line segmentation length for the field integral |
| `hotspot_include` | Include transformer hot-spot heating |
| `pf_include`, `ts_include` | Couple GIC into the power flow and/or transient stability |
| `calc_mode` | `SnapShot` and related calculation modes |
| `zeta`, `eff`, `Px` | Model coefficients |
| `bus_no_sub` | Buses without an assigned substation |
| `update_line_volts` | Whether induced line voltages are refreshed |
| `timevary_csv`, `loadb3d` | Time-varying field input and B3D field data |
| `calc_max_direction` | Solve for the worst-case field direction |
| `A`, `G`, `H` | The assembled model matrices |
| `cleargic` | Clear GIC results |

### Substation grounding is the input that matters most

GIC results are dominated by substation grounding resistance and transformer winding
configuration. A case that has never been prepared for GIC study will have placeholder
grounding data, and it will still produce numbers — plausible-looking, and meaningless.

Before trusting any GIC result, confirm the case actually carries substation grounding
resistances and correct transformer configurations. This is the GIC equivalent of the
silent failures elsewhere in this knowledge base: nothing errors, the answer is simply
not about your system.

### Direction matters, and the worst case is not obvious

GIC magnitude depends on the angle between the geoelectric field and each line. The
worst direction for one transformer is rarely the worst for another, so a single
assumed direction under-reports system risk. Use `calc_max_direction` rather than
guessing, or sweep the direction and keep the envelope.

### Script-level access

Everything above maps to PowerWorld `GIC*` SCRIPT actions — `GICCalculate`,
`GICTimeVaryingCalculate`, `GICSaveGMatrix`, and the PTI/PSLF exchange actions. See
[aux-script-commands](../references/aux-script-commands.md). Reach for those only when the `esapp.utils.GIC` surface does
not cover what you need.

### Scope

This page covers **driving PowerWorld's GIC feature**. It does not teach geomagnetic
hazard assessment, earth-conductivity modelling, or how to choose a storm scenario. For
those, go to the GMD literature and the relevant NERC standards.

## Abstract

**Pairs that get confused** section even if you skip the rest — `PWW` versus `PFW` alone
has cost people entire afternoons, and mixing them produces results that look right.

### Pairs that get confused

Read this table before the alphabetical list. These are near-identical names for
entirely different things, and confusing them produces plausible-looking wrong answers
rather than errors.

| These two | Are not the same |
|---|---|
| **PWW** vs **PFW** | `PWW` is a **weather data file** — measurements at stations over time. `PFW` (Power Flow Weather) is a **model string embedded in a generator** that converts weather into MW for that unit. You load a PWW; a PFW is already inside the case. One letter apart, unrelated |
| **`esapp`** vs **`esa`** | Two different Python packages wrapping the same SimAuto server. This kit assumes `esapp`. Do not mix them |
| **`PowerWorld`** vs **`SAW`** | `PowerWorld` is esapp's high-level entry point. `SAW` is the raw SimAuto wrapper beneath it, reached as `pw.esa`. `pw.RunScriptCommand(...)` does not exist; `pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(...)` does |
| **TimeStep** vs **Transient Stability** | *TimeStep* solves a sequence of independent steady-state points across a weather series — a production study. *Transient stability* (the `TS*` actions) simulates sub-second dynamics. Completely different machinery |
| **`Simulator`** vs **`SimAuto`** | Simulator is the program. SimAuto is its automation interface, **licensed separately**. Having one does not mean having the other |
| **`LimViolPct`** on thermal vs voltage rows | The polarity differs between the two. Never rank the two kinds of violation on this field directly — see [reading-violationctg](../methods/reading-violationctg.md) |
| **`.pwb`** vs **`.aux`** | `.pwb` is the binary case file. `.aux` is a text file of data and/or SCRIPT actions that is **merged into** an open case |

### Alphabetical

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **AC** | Alternating current. An "AC solve" solves the full nonlinear power flow, unlike a DC approximation |
| **ACSR** | Aluminium Conductor Steel Reinforced — the common transmission conductor type |
| **AGC** | Automatic Generation Control — how generation follows load in real time |
| **`.aux`** | PowerWorld Auxiliary file. Text format carrying object data and/or `SCRIPT` action blocks. `LoadAux` **merges** it into the open case rather than replacing anything |
| **Branch** | A transmission line or transformer. Keyed by its two bus numbers plus a circuit identifier |
| **`BusNum`** | A bus's primary key. `BusNum:1` denotes the far end of a branch |
| **CIM** | Common Information Model — a utility data-exchange standard |
| **COM** | Component Object Model, the Windows mechanism SimAuto is built on. A `com_error` is a Windows-level failure, usually meaning SimAuto is unregistered or unlicensed |
| **Contingency / CTG** | A modelled outage. `CTGLabel` is its key. PowerWorld **trims whitespace from `CTGLabel` on load**, so the label you wrote is not always the one you get back |
| **DC solve** | The linearized power-flow approximation. Fast, ignores voltage and reactive power, and **always reports zero mismatch** — it cannot tell you a generation schedule is short |
| **DHI / DNI / GHI** | Diffuse Horizontal, Direct Normal, and Global Horizontal Irradiance. Three different solar measurements; models usually want a specific one |
| **EDIT mode / RUN mode** | PowerWorld's two operating modes. Many data writes are rejected outside EDIT. Switch with `EnterMode` |
| **ERA5** | ECMWF's hourly reanalysis dataset, roughly 0.25° resolution. Good for long historical records |
| **`esapp`** | ESA++, the Python package this kit uses to drive PowerWorld. Provides `PowerWorld`, a bracket interface returning DataFrames, and `SAW` underneath |
| **GIC** | Geomagnetically Induced Current — quasi-DC current driven through the grid by geomagnetic disturbance |
| **HRRR** | NOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh, ~3 km and sub-hourly. Use it to refine a specific window, not to scan a year |
| **Injection group** | A named collection of injections treated as one source or sink in transfer studies |
| **Interface** | A named set of branches whose combined flow is monitored against a limit |
| **Key field** | The column(s) identifying an object: `BusNum` for a bus, `BusNum` + `GenID` for a generator. **Omit them from a DataFrame you write back and the write silently does nothing** |
| **kcmil** | Thousand circular mils — a conductor size unit |
| **LODF** | Line Outage Distribution Factor. How flow redistributes onto other branches when one branch is outaged |
| **Mismatch** | Residual power imbalance at a bus after solving. Near zero means converged — but see *DC solve* |
| **MOC** | Map of Content — a hub page linking a domain's pages. A convention from the source wiki, not a PowerWorld term |
| **MVA / MW / MVAR** | Apparent, real, and reactive power. Branch limits are usually MVA; dispatch is in MW |
| **N-1** | The reliability criterion that the system must survive the loss of any single element |
| **OPF / SCOPF** | Optimal Power Flow, and its Security-Constrained form which additionally respects contingency limits |
| **`.pwb`** | PowerWorld Binary case file — the case itself |
| **PFW** | Power Flow Weather. The model **inside a generator** converting weather to MW. Not a file |
| **Per unit (pu)** | Values normalized to a base. Voltage near 1.0 pu is nominal. Changing the system base re-derives these — see [per-unit-basis-discipline](per-unit-basis-discipline.md) |
| **PTDF** | Power Transfer Distribution Factor. How a transfer between two points distributes across branches |
| **PV / QV study** | Nose-curve and reactive-margin voltage stability analyses. This kit tells you which action runs them, not what they mean |
| **PWW** | PowerWorld Weather file. Station measurements over time — the input to TimeStep |
| **`SAW`** | The SimAuto wrapper object inside esapp, reached as `pw.esa`. Where `RunScriptCommand` lives |
| **SCRIPT action** | A named PowerWorld command such as `SolvePowerFlow` or `SaveCase`, runnable from an `.aux` file or via `RunScriptCommand`. Catalogue: [aux-script-commands](../references/aux-script-commands.md) |
| **Shift factor** | Sensitivity of a branch's flow to a change in injection |
| **SimAuto** | PowerWorld's COM automation server. **Licensed separately from Simulator** |
| **Slack bus** | The bus absorbing system imbalance. It will silently absorb an enormous shortfall and report success, which is why a DC mismatch of zero proves nothing |
| **Super bus** | A group of buses merged by topology processing into one electrical node |
| **TimeStep** | PowerWorld's feature for solving a series of steady-state points across a weather time series. Not dynamics |
| **TS** | Transient Stability. The `TS*` script actions. Genuinely dynamics |
| **UTC** | Coordinated Universal Time. Weather data is usually UTC while case data may be local — check before joining them |

### Terms this kit deliberately does not define

Contingency analysis fundamentals, OPF formulation, PV/QV curve theory, transient
stability theory, and weather science such as dynamic line ratings. This kit is about
**operating PowerWorld**, not teaching power systems. When a task needs that theory, say
so rather than improvising.

# LODF — Line Outage Distribution Factors (DC N-1 in one factorization)

## Abstract

LODF gives **every branch's post-outage MW flow for every single-branch outage** from one
matrix factorization — no per-contingency power-flow solve. It is not an approximation of
DC contingency analysis; measured live it **IS** DC contingency analysis
(`corr = 1.00000000`, `max|err| = 0.0000 MW` vs PowerWorld's own DC CTG), computed ~190×
faster. On Synth8k: the full 13,050-outage table in **5.8 s** versus **1,101 s** for the
10-worker parallel AC sweep ([parallel-contingency-solve](parallel-contingency-solve.md)). Read on for the mechanism, the
free islanding detector that falls out of it, what it structurally cannot do (voltage,
reactive power, losses, control limits, divergence), and the measured verdict that it was
**evaluated and NOT adopted** for reactive power planning — because RPP's binding
constraint is local reactive adequacy, not MW redistribution.

## Connections

## Content

### The idea

Contingency analysis **simulates**: open branch k, re-solve the whole network with
Newton-Raphson, read the result. LODF **precomputes the redistribution**.

It works because **DC power flow is linear** (`f = H·P` — angles and reactances only; no
voltage magnitude, no reactive power, no losses), and linear systems obey superposition.

The trick: instead of *removing* branch k, leave it in place and **inject power at its two
endpoints that exactly cancels its flow**. Electrically identical — a branch carrying zero
current may as well be absent. But an *injection* is something whose response you can
precompute once (that is what PTDF/ISF is). So knowing the response to injections gives you
the response to every outage.

### The formula

```
f_l(after k trips)  =  f_l  +  LODF[l,k] · f_k
                                └──────┘   └─┘
                                 share    orphaned flow
```

`LODF[l,k]` is the fraction of the **outaged** branch's flow that lands on branch `l` — not a
percentage increase of `l`'s own flow. Column `k` is the entire grid's response to losing
`k`, which is why one column answers "what happens everywhere."

**The danger is the product `LODF × f_k`, not the factor alone.** A 0.20 share of a 100 MW
line adds 20 MW; the same 0.20 share of a 400 MW line adds 80 MW. Same factor, opposite
verdict. LODF is also **signed** — always evaluate `|f_new| / limit`.

Where the shares come from:

```
LODF[l,k] = ψ[l,k] / (1 − ψ[k,k])          ψ = diag(b)·A·Xbus   (the ISF / PTDF matrix)
```

The denominator is a **feedback term**. When k's power pushes onto its neighbours, their
changes feed back onto k's own terminals, which pushes again. Expanded,
`1/(1−ψ_kk) = 1 + ψ_kk + ψ_kk² + …` — a geometric series summing every round of
redistribution in closed form.

### Free islanding detection (the part worth keeping regardless)

When `ψ_kk → 1` the denominator → 0 and the shares blow up. Physically: the feedback never
damps because **there is no alternate path** — outaging `k` splits the network. The math
flags it before any solve is attempted. On Synth8k: **420 of 13,470** outages, found in the
~6 s it takes to build the PTDF.

This is a **correctness fix, not a speed optimisation**, and it plugs a real hole: in a
PowerWorld CTG sweep, islanded buses read 0 and get skipped, so stranding a 138 kV pocket
**reports CLEAN**. A free connectivity check turns that silent failure into an explicit list.

### Building it (measured recipe, Synth8k: 8,483 buses / 13,470 branches)

```
A     = incidence (L×N, +1 from / −1 to)      b = 1/x, floor |x| at 1e-5
B'    = Aᵀ·diag(b)·A , delete the slack row/col, factorize (scipy splu)   ~6 s
Xbus  = B'⁻¹ (slack row/col zero-filled)
ψ     = diag(b)·A·Xbus                        (L×N = 0.91 GB float64)
Φ[:,k]= ψ[:,from_k] − ψ[:,to_k]               → LODF[:,k] = Φ[:,k] / (1 − Φ[k,k])
```

Φ is just **column differences of ψ** at the branch endpoints — cheap. Stream the L×L table
in column chunks (512 works) and accumulate statistics rather than materialising it (0.73 GB
in float32 if you do want it whole).

**Take base flows from PowerWorld's own DC solve — do not reconstruct the injection vector.**
On a real case, generation exceeds load by the AC loss provision (4,548 MW on Synth8k). A
hand-built `P` dumps that entire imbalance on the single slack bus while PowerWorld
distributes it, giving a **220 MW max discrepancy**. LODF needs only base flows + topology,
so reading the base flows removes the question. A DC solve is still shunt-blind, so the
property that makes this usable for siting work survives.

### Measured verdict (Synth8k, `ctg/lodf_vs_ctg.ipynb`, 2026-08-10)

**1 — LODF *is* DC contingency analysis, exactly.**

| | |
|---|---|
| LODF vs PowerWorld DC CTG | `corr = 1.00000000`, `max\|err\| = 0.0000 MW` |

Not "a good approximation" — within DC's linear world, "delete the branch and re-solve" and
"apply the compensating injection by superposition" are the *same algebraic operation*
(Sherman–Morrison). Same answer, far less arithmetic.

**2 — Cost.**

| Method | Full 13,050-outage sweep |
|---|---|
| **LODF** (+6.0 s PTDF, once per topology) | **5.8 s** |
| PowerWorld DC, serial | 2,106 s |
| PowerWorld AC, serial | 6,025 s |
| PowerWorld AC, 10-worker parallel | 1,101 s |

PTDF depends **only on topology**, so it is built once and reused: **each additional scenario
costs one matrix-vector product**, not another sweep. That is the property that answers
"more scenarios = linearly more time."

**3 — Rank fidelity vs AC is high, and the residual is DC's fault, not LODF's.**

```
per-substation stress, Spearman:   ρ(LODF, AC) = 0.9929
                                   ρ(PW_DC, AC) = 0.9929   ← identical to 4 dp
top-k set agreement (LODF vs AC):  top 5% J=0.936 · top 22% J=0.920 · top 50% J=0.955
```

LODF gives up **literally nothing** versus running the real DC sweep. The whole gap to AC is
the DC/AC modelling gap (base flows: `corr 0.981`, mean 5.5 MW, **8.5 % mean relative**).

**4 — Predicting individual AC flow *changes* is mediocre**, and again identical for both:

| mover threshold | 1 MW | 5 | 10 | 25 | 50 | 100 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `corr(ΔLODF, ΔAC)` | .6430 | .6493 | .6592 | .6990 | .7733 | .8492 |
| `corr(ΔPW-DC, ΔAC)` | .6430 | .6493 | .6592 | .6990 | .7733 | .8492 |

Good enough to **rank**; not good enough to read a post-contingency loading number off.

### UPDATE 2026-08-25 — the "does not compose" limitation is SOLVED in the literature

2026 08 18 population b corridor collapse dropped LODF partly because *"single-row LODF does
not compose across simultaneous outages, and 209 corridors go out together."* **That is true for
chaining rank-1 updates one at a time — and that is not the only way to do it.**

**Ronellenfitsch, Manik, Hörsch, Brown, Witthaut, *"Dual theory of transmission line outages"*,
arXiv:1606.07276v2** (primary text verified 2026-08-25). Abstract:

> *"a new formula for the computation of Line Outage Distribution Factors (LODFs) is derived,
> which is not only computationally faster than existing methods, but also generalizes easily for
> multiple line outages and **arbitrary changes to line series reactance**."*

- **Eq. (28) — ARBITRARY REACTANCE CHANGE, not just outage.** For `x_ℓ -> x_ℓ + ξ_ℓ`:
  `ΔF = [ -ξ_ℓ F_ℓ / (1 + ξ_ℓ u_ℓᵀ M u_ℓ) ] · M u_ℓ`, with `M = C A⁻¹ Cᵀ`. Ordinary LODF is the
  `ξ→∞` limit (Eq. 29). The paper flags this generality for *"series compensation devices... or
  adjustable inductors"*. **A new parallel circuit is exactly this case**: two lines of `x` in
  parallel give `x/2`, i.e. `ξ = -x/2` — finite and negative.
- **Eq. (35) — M SIMULTANEOUS changes, JOINTLY:**
  `ΔF = -CA⁻¹Cᵀ U (𝟙 + Ξ UᵀMU)⁻¹ Ξ UᵀF`
  One **joint low-rank correction** via a single M×M inverse — NOT a sequential composition of M
  rank-1 updates, so **no accumulated chaining error**. Exact within DC linearity.

**Scope limits, precisely.** "Exact" removes the SEQUENTIAL-COMPOSITION error, not the DC
linearisation itself. The paper does NOT cover adding a corridor where no branch existed (that
needs the cycle basis extended, not a row perturbed). And **no literature was found** bounding a
linear pre-screen's error as a function of the NUMBER of simultaneous changes — so use it to
SHRINK a candidate list, then confirm the shortlist with a real solve.

**Where this lands:** the composition objection does not block LODF for
contingency remediation's DC subsystem. Its ~93 changes are all reactance perturbations on
EXISTING corridors (measured: 42 single-circuit, 3 double), and its 454 rating bumps do not touch
these matrices at all — a rating change moves no flow, only the limit you compare against. Both
reasons LODF was rejected for RPP also **invert** there: that case has 482 corridors over 100%
(worst 296%) rather than 2, and it is a DC study by design so DC's blindness costs it nothing.
See `RESEARCH-2026-08-25.md` in that repo.

### Why it was NOT adopted for RPP

Two independent reasons, both measured — neither is "LODF is inaccurate":

1. **No thermal headroom to discriminate on.** Across all outages, exactly **2 branches**
   exceed 100 % loading (max `1.000014`). TAMU synthetic grids are built N-1 thermally
   secure, so a correct detector runs on a grid engineered to have no positives. *(This is
   itself a reusable validation check for grid statistics: does a synthetic case's rating
   set actually satisfy N-1?)*
2. **N-1 barely moves the ranking.** `Spearman(base-case stress, full-N-1 stress) = 0.8893` —
   the contingency dimension mostly reproduces the base-case stress signal already computed.

And the structural reason it can never carry RPP's late stage: **LODF inherits all of DC's
blindness** — no voltage (every bus pinned at 1.0 pu), no reactive power, no losses, no
generator VAr limits / tap changes / switched-shunt action, and it can never return "did not
converge," which is sometimes the physically meaningful answer. RPP's real violations are
69/138 kV low-side buses sagging from a **local MVAr deficit**; exact MW bookkeeping cannot

### PowerWorld / esapp traps found while measuring this

Each cost real time; all measured 2026-08-10.

- **`pw.dc_mode` is effectively one-way.** Setting it `False` moves the case to AC; setting it
  `True` does **not** move it back, so every later "DC" solve silently stays AC. Use the
  explicit script commands and verify: `SolvePowerFlow(DC);` vs
  `SolvePowerFlow(POLARNEWT);`. **The only unambiguous test is that a real DC solve pins every
  bus to exactly 1.0 pu** — check it, don't trust the flag.
- **`Branch.LineStatus` is rejected as read-only** by esapp's bracket writer, *even in edit
  mode* (`pw[Branch] = df` → `Cannot set read-only field(s)`). The `OpenBranch(...)` /
  `Open(...)` script commands fail validation. What works:
  `pw.esa.RunScriptCommand('SetData(Branch, [BusNum,BusNum:1,LineCircuit,LineStatus], [f,t,"ckt","Open"]);')`
  — consistent with [powerworld-limitset-setdata](../methods/powerworld-limitset-setdata.md).
- **`pw.lodf(branch)` exists in esapp but is per-branch** — 13k COM round-trips. Build the
  matrix yourself.
- **Always confirm the case solves before analysing it.** A freshly-opened `.pwb` returns
  plausible-looking `LineMW` from its *saved* state, so an analysis that never calls a solve
  will read sane numbers off an unsolvable case. A **DC solve is a linear system and cannot
  legitimately fail** — if it does, the case is broken, not the contingency.
- **Do not average error over the whole (branch × outage) table.** ~2 M entries are dominated
  by branches far from the outage that trivially do not move, which flatters any method to
  `mean |err| ≈ 0`. Measure error on the **flow change**, restricted to branches that actually
  moved, and against **each solver's own base** (mixing a DC base with an AC result folds the
  792 MW DC/AC gap into the thing being tested).

# Parallel N-1 Contingency Solve (OS-process level)

## Abstract

A workaround for PowerWorld's own distributed `CTGSolveAll` being non-functional in this
environment: instead of relying on PowerWorld's DS server + registered compute hosts (which never
spawn workers here — it silently degrades to single-process serial), split the case's contingency
set into N chunks and run N independent `pwrworld.exe`/esapp instances as separate OS processes
(Python `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`), each solving a plain serial `CTGSolveAll` on
only its own chunk, then merge the per-bus voltage envelopes. Built for reactive power planning
(`ctg/contingency_parallel.py`) to unblock the Synth8k N-1 sweep, which was timing out at 7200s
(2 hrs) serial. Live-measured: **~6-7x faster on the 8k case** (18.4 min vs. the 2-hr timeout,
13,470+ contingencies), but only **~1.7-1.8x on a smaller 2k case** (5,344 contingencies) — the
speedup scales with per-contingency solve cost because each worker pays a fixed ~20-45 sec
`open()` overhead that does not parallelize away.

## Content

### Why PowerWorld's own distributed computing doesn't help here

`CTGSolveAll(distributed=True)` requires a running DS (distributed-solve) server plus registered
compute hosts already set up in PowerWorld Simulator. On this machine, `VerifyDistributedComputersAvailable`
confirms the server is reachable but **zero workers ever actually spawn** — PowerWorld silently
falls back to single-process serial. That's a real, previously-diagnosed blocker: the Synth8k
case's ~13,470-contingency N-1 set was timing out at 7200s (2 hrs) running serial. Distributed
computing settings are also GLOBAL Simulator settings, not serialized into the `.pwb` — so there is
no case-level fix, only an infrastructure one (standing up a real DS server), which is out of scope.

### The workaround: OS-process-level parallelism, not PowerWorld-level

Sidestep PowerWorld's distributed-computing feature entirely and parallelize one level up, at the
OS process level:

```
Case's existing CTGLabel set (already autoinserted + saved to a case file)
        │
        ▼  split into N chunks (np.array_split)
  N independent OS processes, each:
    - opens its OWN esapp/PowerWorld instance on the SAME case file
    - sets CTGSkip=NO only for its own chunk's labels, YES for everything else
    - runs a plain serial CTGSolveAll on just its chunk
    - returns its own per-bus Bus.BusMin/MaxVoltageContingency envelope
        │
        ▼  merge (pure function, no PowerWorld)
  min-of-mins on BusMinVoltageContingency, max-of-maxes on BusMaxVoltageContingency,
  joined on BusNum → same output shape as the serial function
```

This works because concurrent *independent* PowerWorld/esapp instances are safe on this machine —
the earlier assumption of "single-instance SimAuto" was proven wrong by a live probe (3 concurrent
handles, isolated reads+writes); the real rule is just **never call `.exit()`** on a shared/ambient
instance, not "one instance only." Each worker here opens and owns its own instance for its own
process lifetime, so that's a non-issue.

### CPU/RAM headroom — don't naively use `os.cpu_count()` workers

Live-measured on an i9-12900K (16 physical / 24 logical cores): 10 worker processes pegged the
**whole machine** near 100% CPU. Each `pwrworld.exe` worker burns **more than one logical core
internally** (PowerWorld's own sparse-solver threading is not user-controllable or documented), so
"1 worker == 1 logical core" is the wrong mental model — observed ratio was roughly 2.4 logical
threads per worker at `n_workers=10`. A `recommended_workers()` helper computes a conservative
default from both CPU headroom (`(logical_cores − reserve) // per_worker_cores`, defaults
`reserve=2`, `per_worker_cores=3`) and RAM headroom (`available_mb // per_worker_mb`, default
700 MB/worker, measured from the 8k run's actual `pwrworld.exe` footprints of ~150-600 MB each),
returning whichever bound is tighter. On this machine that resolves to **7**, not 10.

### GPU is not an option

PowerWorld's solver (`pwrworld.exe`) is a closed-source CPU sparse-LU Newton-Raphson engine
accessed only through the SimAuto/COM interface. There is no GPU path in PowerWorld itself, and
[esapp](esapp.md) is a thin Python wrapper around that COM interface — it cannot inject GPU acceleration
into solver internals it doesn't control. The only real lever for CTG solve speed here is OS-level
process parallelism (this technique), not GPU offload.

### Correctness check + measured numbers

Because this changes *how* the sweep runs but not the physics, the parallel result should exactly
match the serial baseline's violating-bus set — verified live (`ctg_parallel_demo.ipynb`, both
sweeps run back to back on the same case + same contingency set):

| Case | Contingencies | Serial | Parallel | Workers | Speedup | Match? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Synth2k series25 summerpeak | 5,344 (3,993 line + 1,351 xfmr) | 196-266 s | 107-152 s | 10 | 1.75-1.84x | Yes, exact violating-bus set |
| Synth8k (a ~13.5k-bus working model) | ~13,520 | ~7200 s (prior timeout, never completed) | 1,101 s (18.4 min) | 10 | ~6-7x vs. the timeout budget | 149 violating buses found |

The speedup ratio is **not constant** — it grows with case size / per-contingency solve cost,
because the fixed per-worker `open()` overhead (20-45 sec, does not parallelize away) is a much
smaller fraction of total time on the bigger, slower-per-contingency 8k case than on the smaller 2k
case. Run-to-run variance on the identical 2k case was also notable (196 s vs 266 s, ~35%) — likely
machine/process contention, not a code issue; don't trust a single sample when planning capacity
for a big sweep.

### Scope limitation (deliberate)

This technique parallelizes ONLY the base N-1 voltage sweep, not any per-contingency remediation
walk that mutates a shared base fleet sequentially (e.g. RPP's after-removal 2b security loop) —
that kind of loop can't be split this way since each fix changes state the next step depends on.
It also does not autoinsert contingencies itself — the case must already carry its N-1 set before
the parallel sweep opens it (autoinsert once, save, then hand that saved case path to the workers).

# Per-unit basis discipline — a normalized number is meaningless without its base

## Abstract

A per-unit or normalized quantity is a **pair**: the number *and* the base it was
normalized against. Store only the number and you have stored nothing recoverable — yet
per-unit values look like plain scalars, so they get copied between sources, written into
shared columns, and summed, with the base silently changing underneath. This page is the
reusable form of a mistake that hit dispatch twice: the second time *because* the
documented fix was written down without its precondition. Read it before mixing a
case-read normalized quantity with a synthesized or textbook one, and before trusting any
"correct formula" recorded from a previous session.

## Content

### The rule

> A per-unit value carries an implicit denominator. Two per-unit numbers are only
> comparable — and only **summable** — if they share a base.

Three failure shapes, in increasing order of nastiness:

1. **Wrong base, uniformly.** Everything is off by one constant factor. Bad, but the error
   is visible in totals and usually caught by a sanity check.
2. **Wrong base, non-uniformly.** The base varies per device, so the error varies per
   device. Totals are wrong *and* any **ordering, ranking, or selection** built on the
   values is wrong. This is far worse, and much harder to spot, because nothing looks
   obviously broken — it just quietly picks the wrong equipment.
3. **Two different bases in one column.** A field populated from two code paths — read
   from source on one, synthesized on the other — where only one path re-bases. The column
   name is now a lie for half its rows.

### The worked case: PowerWorld `TSH`

The inertia constant H (seconds) is per-unit on **each machine's own MVA base**.
PowerWorld's `Gen.TSH` is the same H re-based onto a fixed **100 MVA system base**:

```
TSH = H · GenMVABase / 100          system inertia (GW·s) = Σ TSH · 100 / 1000
```

Both expressions are "inertia in seconds." Neither is wrong. They are not interchangeable.

On the Synth8k case `GenMVABase` spans **2.2 – 1,444.4 MVA (median 170)**, so treating
assumed H as if it were `TSH` produced failure shape **2**: fleet inertia read 240.5 GW·s
instead of 470.3, nuclear 2.04 instead of 22.58, and the unit-commitment order in the
dispatch algorithm was silently wrong. Full numbers in
2026 07 27 inertia basis regression.

The physical statement underneath: **H alone is not an inertia quantity.** ERCOT defines
`M_sys = Σ Hᵢ · MVAᵢ`. Seconds must be size-weighted before they mean anything at system
level — which is also why *unit count is not a proxy for system inertia*.

### The meta-lesson: guidance inherits preconditions

This is the part worth carrying to every other project, and it is why the bug recurred.

The 2026-07-14 session found the original inertia error and recorded the fix as a rule:

> `GW·s = Σ(Gen.TSH) · 100 / 1000` — **do NOT multiply by `GenMVABase`, it's already
> implicit.**

That is correct — *for values read out of a case*. It was written down without the
qualifier, because at the time only one data path existed. Later a case arrived with **no
measured `TSH` at all**, so H had to be synthesized from published typical values. On that
path the rule **inverts**: you must multiply. Anyone — human or agent — following the
recorded guidance while writing the new path would produce exactly the bug that shipped.
And one did, in all three builders.

> **A documented correction is only valid under the conditions of the data it was derived
> from.** When you record a rule, record what made it true. When you *apply* a recorded
> rule, check that its precondition still holds — especially if the data source changed.

Practical habit: state the rule's scope in the same sentence as the rule.
"Don't multiply by the base" → "don't multiply by the base **when reading `Gen.TSH` from
the case, because it is already re-based**."

### How to make it stick (what actually worked)

Documentation alone demonstrably failed here — it was written down and the bug still
recurred. Two mechanical guards were added instead, and both earn their keep:

- **Assert on the physical magnitude, at compute time.** `assert 460 <= fleet_gws <= 480`
  in the notebook cell catches every wrong-base variant regardless of how it was
  introduced, because it checks the *answer*, not the code. Cheap and high-yield.
- **Assert on the code shape, in CI.** A source-level test that greps the conversion works
  without a PowerWorld licence — but write it **precisely**. The first version accepted
  `/ 1000` (because `"100" in "1000"`) and an inverted `H · 100 / GenMVABase`. Anchor the
  regex and mutation-test the guard by reintroducing the bug and confirming it fails. A
  guard that silently accepts the defect is worse than none: it advertises coverage it
  doesn't have.

Prefer the magnitude assert if you only do one. It is source-agnostic and it fires before
a wrong number reaches a document.

### Checklist when a normalized quantity enters a project

- What is the base — system-wide constant, per-device, or per-zone?
- Does every row in this column share it? If the column is populated from more than one
  source, the answer is probably no.
- Does the base *vary across devices*? If yes, a wrong base corrupts **ordering**, not just
  totals — check any ranking or selection downstream.
- Is there a physical sanity band (a published typical range) to assert against?
- If I am reusing a recorded formula: what data path was it derived for, and am I on it?

# PowerWorld inertia (`TSH`) and cost (`GenMCost`) field semantics

## Abstract

Four non-obvious PowerWorld/esapp case-data facts, all discovered the hard way while
building dispatch's HRML algorithm and worth knowing before any project touches
generator inertia or cost data: (1) `Gen.TSH` is H on a **100 MVA system base**, not
the generator's own `GenMVABase` — **and the "don't multiply by `GenMVABase`" rule that
follows from it inverts the moment you synthesize H yourself instead of reading it**
(this bit a second time on 2026-07-27; see the ⛔ box in §1 before writing any inertia
code); (2) `Gen.GenMCost` is a **live** cost-curve
evaluation at the case's *current* `GenMW`, not a fixed per-unit rate; (3) ERCOT's 8
weather zones are already modeled natively as `AreaNum`/`AreaName` on Synth2k-series
cases — no spatial join needed; (4) a sibling project's fuel-category *name* doesn't
always match its actual `GenFuelType` mapping — verify against source code, not the
label. Read the Content section before writing any code that sums inertia, ranks
generators by cost, needs zonal load data on a Synth2k case, or reconstructs
per-generator detail from another project's category-level summary.

## Content

### 1. `Gen.TSH` (inertia constant H) is on a 100 MVA system base

`esapp` has no `GenInertia` attribute — inertia lives on the `Gen` object as `TSH`.
But `Gen.TSH`, read via `pw[Gen, ["TSH", "GenMVABase"]]`, is **not** the per-unit
inertia constant on the generator's own MVA base — it's H expressed on a fixed
**100 MVA system base**, a standard PSS/E-style dynamics convention. Confirmed two
independent ways on a real Synth2k case:

- **Round-number test:** converting via `H = TSH * 100 / GenMVABase` lands every
  nuclear unit and 19/21 coal units on exactly `4.00` seconds, squarely inside
  ERCOT's published Table 1 ranges (Nuclear 3.8–4.34s, Coal 2.9–4.5s) — not a
  coincidence at that precision.
- **Direct cross-check:** the case's own `MachineModel_GENROU` (round-rotor) and
  `MachineModel_GENSAL` (salient-pole, e.g. hydro) dynamic model objects expose a
  `TSH` field of their own, and it reads the true per-unit H **directly, no
  conversion needed** — e.g. `4.0` for the same generator whose `Gen.TSH` reads
  `56.888`. The ratio between the two paths is exactly `GenMVABase/100` for every
  unit tested, confirming the basis rather than just approximating it.

**Correct formula** for total system inertia (GW·s) over online synchronous units,
**when `TSH` is read from the case**:
```
GW·s = Σ(Gen.TSH) * 100 / 1000     # do NOT multiply by GenMVABase -- already implicit
```
Multiplying `TSH * GenMVABase` (the intuitive-looking but wrong formula) overstates
inertia by roughly `GenMVABase/100` per unit — ~13x too high for a ~1,400 MVA nuclear
unit.

`MachineModel_GENROU`/`GENSAL`'s own `TSH` is the more robust source (no
conversion arithmetic to get wrong) but only covers round-rotor + salient-pole units —
verify the two object types' record counts sum to the full synchronous fleet before
trusting it on a new case family.

### 2. `Gen.GenMCost` is a live evaluation at the case's *current* `GenMW`

`GenMCost` (marginal cost, $/MWh) is not a fixed per-unit number — it's PowerWorld
re-evaluating each generator's cost curve (`GenCostModel`, `GenCostCurvePoints`) at
whatever `GenMW` the case currently holds. Confirmed: `GenMW` correlates **0.95** with
`GenMCost` in a real case (marginal cost rises with output, as expected for a convex
cost curve).

**Consequence:** if you want to rank generators by cost *at a specific dispatch
point* (e.g. their `GenMWMin`, for a must-run/backstop step), reading `GenMCost` as-is
gives you cost at whatever the base case's *original* operating point was — which can
differ from the true value at your intended dispatch point by double digits of percent
(one tested unit: 6.37 → 5.56 $/MWh, a ~13% swing, when forced from its base-case
`GenMW` down to `GenMWMin`).

**Technique — live re-evaluation without saving:** temporarily overwrite `GenMW` for
the candidates via the bracket write interface, re-read `GenMCost`, then restore the
original `GenMW` — entirely in-memory against the live SimAuto session, nothing ever
written to the `.pwb`:
```python
orig = pw[Gen, ["BusNum", "GenID", "GenMW"]]
mw_at_target = orig["GenMW"].copy()
mw_at_target[mask] = target_values  # e.g. GenMWMin for the units you care about
pw[Gen, "GenMW"] = mw_at_target.tolist()

recomputed_cost = pw[Gen, ["BusNum", "GenID", "GenMCost"]]

pw[Gen, "GenMW"] = orig["GenMW"].tolist()  # restore -- verify max diff == 0.0
```
This generalizes to any PowerWorld field that's live-derived from `GenMW` (or other
mutable state) rather than stored directly — check for this before trusting a
"looks like a fixed property" field.

**Two silent-zero traps:** `GenCostCurvePoints == 0` means no cost curve was ever fit
(cost fields read `0`), and a handful of units can report `GenMCost == 0` even with
curve points defined. Both mean "no real cost data," never "free" — guard explicitly
(`GenCostCurvePoints > 0 AND GenMCost > 0`) before using cost data to rank or select
generators, or a data gap silently becomes "dispatch this first."

### 3. ERCOT's 8 weather zones are already `AreaNum`/`AreaName`

On Synth2k-series cases, `AreaNum`/`AreaName` (native PowerWorld fields, on both
`Gen` and `Load` objects) already encode ERCOT's 8 official weather zones — Far West,
North, West, South, North Central, South Central, Coast, East — verified present and
fully populated on both the summerpeak and low-load Synth2k cases. No spatial join
needed for zonal load/generation analysis on this case family.

Don't confuse this with the separate **ISO-region** field (`CustomString:2`, written
by a case-specific `iso_insertion.py` spatial join against an ISO-boundary shapefile)
— that field is (a) generator-scoped only, never written to loads, and (b) on the
Synth2k case, ~96%/~4%/~0.06% across three ISO regions — one bucket dominates, nearly
useless for zonal differentiation within ERCOT. `AreaNum` is the right key when the
goal is *intra-ERCOT* zonal granularity (e.g. matching a MIN-load case's zonal load
shape); ISO region is the right key only when the analysis genuinely needs
separation between ISO regions.

### 4. A sibling project's fuel-category name doesn't always mean what it says

Not a PowerWorld field-semantics gotcha but the same *don't-take-a-label-at-face-value*
family: a sibling dispatch script's `"GAS_CT"` category actually maps to Synth8k's
`GenFuelType == "DFO (Distillate Fuel Oil)"`, not `"NG (Natural Gas)"` — confirmed by
reading the source's own fuel-classification code, not inferred from the name.
Conflating the two misassigns `TSH`/cost and mis-totals capacity. See
2026 07 14 hrml scenario validation for the full trace. General lesson: when
reconstructing per-generator detail from another project's per-category summary
output, verify the category↔`GenFuelType` mapping against that project's actual
classification code, never the category's plain-English name.

# PowerWorld SimAuto

## Abstract

SimAuto is PowerWorld Simulator's COM Automation Server — the Windows-only layer that all PowerWorld Python scripts ultimately talk to. In esapp it is wrapped by the `SAW` class (assembled via ~20 mixins) and reached through `pw.esa`. This page covers the SAW mixin architecture, verified raw COM method signatures for data, scripting, solving, and state management, and the exception hierarchy. Use it when the high-level `pw[...]` bracket API isn't sufficient and you need to call `pw.esa` directly.

## Content

**SimAuto** is PowerWorld Simulator's COM **Automation Server** — it exposes the
running simulator to external scripts (open cases, read/write objects, solve
power flow, run script commands, switch EDIT/RUN modes). It is the layer
*underneath* [esapp](esapp.md). In esapp it is wrapped by the **`SAW` (SimAuto Wrapper)**
class and reached through `pw.esa`. Because it is a COM server, everything here
is **Windows-only** (esapp talks to it via `pywin32`).

## SAW — the wrapper esapp puts on top

`SAW` lives in `esapp/saw/saw.py` and is assembled by the **mixin pattern**:
`SAWBase` (`saw/base.py`, core COM interface + case management + generic data
retrieval) plus ~20 capability mixins — `DataMixin`, `PowerflowMixin`,
`MatrixMixin`, `ContingencyMixin`, `TransientMixin`, `SensitivityMixin`,
`GICMixin`, `OPFMixin`, `PVMixin`, `QVMixin`, `ATCMixin`, `FaultMixin`,
`TopologyMixin`, `RegionsMixin`, `ModifyMixin`, `GeneralMixin`,
`CaseActionsMixin`, `ScheduledActionsMixin`, `TimeStepMixin`, `WeatherMixin`.

You rarely instantiate `SAW` directly — `PowerWorld.open()` does
`SAW(fname, CreateIfNotFound=True, early_bind=True)` and stores it on `pw.esa`.

## Raw calls (when the bracket interface isn't enough)

Real method names, verified in `esapp/saw/`:

```python
# Generic read/write (esapp/saw/data.py)
pw.esa.GetParametersMultipleElement("Bus", ["BusNum", "BusPUVolt"])
pw.esa.GetParamsRectTyped("Bus", ["BusNum", "BusPUVolt"])          # typed DataFrame; backs pw[...]
pw.esa.ChangeParametersSingleElement("Gen", ["BusNum","GenID","GenMW"], ["1","1","100"])
pw.esa.ChangeParametersMultipleElement("Gen", cols, values)
pw.esa.ChangeParametersMultipleElementRect("Bus", cols, df)        # backs pw[Type] = df

# Mode + scripting (saw/general.py, saw/base.py)
pw.esa.EnterMode("EDIT"); pw.esa.EnterMode("RUN")                  # or PowerWorldMode.EDIT/.RUN
pw.esa.SolvePowerFlow()          # call the NAMED wrapper, not RunScriptCommand: 310
                                 # SCRIPT commands are wrapped, and the wrapper gives you a
                                 # typed signature plus correct argument-string building.
                                 # The real win is ONE PATCH POINT — a hand-written string
                                 # is a call site the esapp maintainer can never reach when
                                 # PowerWorld changes a command's syntax. esapp does NOT
                                 # introspect PowerWorld's command table or check the
                                 # Simulator version; this is an upgrade path, not a
                                 # runtime check.

# Solve / matrices / TS (saw/powerflow.py, matrices.py, transient.py)
pw.esa.SolvePowerFlow(SolverMethod.RECTNEWT)
pw.esa.get_ybus(); pw.esa.get_jacobian()
pw.esa.TSInitialize(); pw.esa.TSSolve(ctg); pw.esa.TSGetResults(...)

# State save/restore (used by pw.snapshot())
pw.esa.SaveState(); pw.esa.LoadState()
```

`EnterMode` accepts the `PowerWorldMode` enum or the raw strings `"EDIT"` /
`"RUN"`. Object creation through the bracket interface needs **EDIT mode** plus
`CreateIfNotFound=True` on the SAW.

## Why it matters here

Everything in this wiki that touches a `.pwb` case ultimately goes through
SimAuto. esapp wraps it so you almost always use `pw[...]` and `pw.pflow()`
instead of raw COM, but the raw calls remain available on `pw.esa` for anything
the high-level API doesn't cover (time-step runs via `TimeStepMixin`, weather
via `WeatherMixin`, OPF/PV/QV, fault analysis, etc.).

## Exceptions

SAW raises a typed hierarchy rooted at `PowerWorldError` (`saw/_exceptions.py`):
`COMError`, `CommandNotRespectedError`, `SimAutoFeatureError`,
`PowerWorldPrerequisiteError`, `PowerWorldAddonError`. The bracket-write path
keys off `PowerWorldPrerequisiteError` ("not found") to decide whether to create
new objects.

# PWW data (PowerWorld Weather)

## Abstract

PWW (PowerWorld Weather) is a custom byte-packed binary format produced by weather auto and consumed by PowerWorld Simulator's TimeStep Simulation engine. It encodes gridded weather variables as uint8 values (0–254) per timestep and grid point, with 255 as the NaN sentinel. This page covers the VERSION 2 binary spec, variable encoding formulas, per-source production pipelines (ERA5, HRRR, GFS, WRF), and verification procedures. Drill deeper when writing or debugging a PWW file, or tracing weather data into a timestep study.

## Content

**Step 3 of the flagship trail.** ← prev: [timestep-simulation-setup](../methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md) · next: [how-to-analyze-results](../methods/how-to-analyze-results.md).

> **Firewall: PWW ≠ PFW.** PWW = weather *data* files (this page). PFW = the PowerFlow Weather *model* used in pfw copperplate. Never cross-link their aliases.

PWW is a **custom byte-packed binary format** produced by weather auto and consumed by PowerWorld Simulator's TimeStep Simulation engine. It encodes gridded weather variables at discrete timesteps as uint8 values, one byte per variable per grid point per timestep.

## Binary Format (VERSION 2)

All values are **little-endian**. Types: `h`=int16, `i`=int32, `d`=float64, `u8`=uint8.

```
Offset  Type    Field
──────  ──────  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0       h       KEY1 = 2001
2       h       KEY2 = 8066  (8065 = VERSION 1; 8066 signals VERSION 2)
4       h       VERSION = 2
6       d       date_min  (OLE automation date — days since 1899-12-30)
14      d       date_max
22      d       lat_min / lat_max / lon_min / lon_max   (4 × d = 32 bytes)
54      h       META_STRINGS  (≥ 1 for VERSION 2)
56      cstr[]  meta_strings[META_STRINGS]  — "PowerWorld Timestep Simulation Weather\0"
─       i       COUNT       (number of timesteps)
─       i       SAMPLE_seconds  (3600=hourly, 900=15-min subh, 0=irregular)
─       i       LOC         (number of stations / grid points)
─       h       LOC_FC = 0
─       h       VARCOUNT
─       h[]     var_codes[VARCOUNT]
─       h       BYTECOUNT = VARCOUNT  (always VARCOUNT when all vars are uint8)
─       i[]     valid_counts[VARCOUNT]   ← VERSION 2 only — non-255 count per variable
─               station_records[LOC]   lat(d), lon(d), elev(h), who(cstr), country(cstr), region(cstr)
─       u8[]    data_array[COUNT × VARCOUNT × n_lat × n_lon]  — C order, 255 = NaN sentinel
```

**Grid dimensions** are derived from header bounds (ERA5 grid is 0.25°):
```python
n_lat = round((lat_max - lat_min) / 0.25) + 1
n_lon = round((lon_max - lon_min) / 0.25) + 1
```

**Longitude convention:** descending east→west (e.g. −60 → −130 for CONUS). Lat is ascending south→north.

**OLE epoch:** 1899-12-30. Timestamps before this date encode as negative and PowerWorld rejects the file — pre-1900 data must be re-based forward (the WRF 1899 job shifted to 1999, +100 years, preserving month/day/hour).

## VERSION 2 Traps (undocumented — the spec doc only covers VERSION 1)

Three requirements that are silently missing from the format doc but are critical for PowerWorld to parse the file correctly:

1. **KEY2 = 8066** (not 8065 — this magic number signals VERSION 2 to the loader)
2. **META_STRINGS ≥ 1** with at least one description string
3. **VARCOUNT × int32 valid_count block** between BYTECOUNT and station data — counts non-255 values per variable

Without all three, PowerWorld misaligns the byte stream: station block bytes are read as valid counts, producing nonsense `ValidPercent*` values (e.g. 1267%, 990%) and shifted variable readings (temperature showing cloud cover bytes, etc.).

## Variable Codes and Encoding

All values stored as **uint8 (0–254)**; **255 = NaN sentinel** (excluded from valid counts).

| Code | Variable | Encoding formula | Unit stored |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 102 | tempF | `round(°F + 115)` | °F+115 offset |
| 104 | DewPointF | `round(°F + 115)` | °F+115 offset |
| 106 | WindSpeedmph | `round(m/s × 2.236936)` | mph (10 m) |
| 107 | WindDirection | `round(degrees / 5)` — division INSIDE round() | ×5 to decode |
| 119 | CloudCoverPerc | `round(fraction × 100)` — GFS/ERA5 tcc is 0.0–1.0, must ×100 | % |
| 110 | WindSpeed100mph | `round(m/s × 2.236936)` | mph (100 m) — ERA5, GFS |
| 112 | WindSpeed80mph | `round(m/s × 2.236936)` | mph (80 m) — HRRR only |
| 120 | GHI | `round(W/m² / 5)` | ×5 to decode |
| 121 | DHI | `round(W/m² / 5)` | ×5 to decode |
| 136 | WindGust | `round(m/s × 2.236936)` | mph |
| 151 | PrecipitationRate | `round(kg/m²/s × 3600)` | mm/hr |
| 150 | PercentFrozenPrecip | direct percent byte | % — HRRR only |
| 122 | VerticallyIntegratedSmoke | `round(40 × log10(colmd × 1e6))` | dBZ-equiv — HRRR only |

**Wind direction encoding trap:** the division MUST be inside `round()` — `round(degrees / 5)`, never `round(degrees) / 5`. The latter truncates (not rounds) on uint8 cast, causing up to 4° systematic error.

**Code-112 PowerWorld bug:** PowerWorld's TimeStep loader throws an access violation on code 112 (no loadable 80 m wind field in PowerWorld). HRRR pipelines deliberately keep 112 because their wind is genuinely 80 m — this is a confirmed vendor bug under pursuit. Do NOT remap 112→110.

## How PWW Is Produced

weather auto runs four Docker pipelines, each writing a different PWW flavor:

| Pipeline | SAMPLE_sec | Variables | Output naming |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| ERA5/CDS | 3600 (hourly) | 9 (no precip/smoke) | `{Region}{YYYY}_Q{Q}.pww` |
| NOAA/GFS forecast | 3600 | 8 (no DHI — written as 255) | `Forecast_{Region}_Run{YYYY-MM-DD}T{HH}Z.pww` |
| HRRR Forecast | 3600 | 10 | `{YYYY-MM-DD}T{HH}Z_sfc_48_CONUS.pww` |
| HRRR History (15-min) | 900 | 10 | `{YYYY-MM-DD}_Q{1..4}_subh_15min_CONUS.pww` |
| HRRR History (hourly) | 3600 | 10 | `{YYYY-MM-DD}_hourly_CONUS.pww` |
| WRF (Dr. Bailey) | varies | 9 (no precip) | `WRF_{period}_{Region}.pww` |

ERA5 also emits a human-readable `.parquet` alongside the PWW.

## Who Consumes PWW

- dynamic line rating — weather around each line for IEEE 738 thermal rating
- extreme temperature — hottest/coldest scenario identification
- pfw copperplate — weather inputs for the PFW model on renewables
- Any [timestep-simulation](timestep-simulation.md) study needing time-varying weather driving

## Using PWW in a Study

1. Pick spatial/temporal crop (via weather website API or weather extract)
2. Map weather to case elements (lines, renewable units, load zones)
3. Feed per-timestep into the run — see [timestep-simulation-setup](../methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md)
4. Analyze → [how-to-analyze-results](../methods/how-to-analyze-results.md)

## Verifying a PWW (do both before trusting a new file)

1. **Structural + positional round-trip** (offline): parse header, assert KEY2=8066, VERSION=2, ≥1 meta string, valid_count block length == VARCOUNT, data size == COUNT × VARCOUNT × LOC. Then pick a few stations and confirm decoded bytes match the source grid cell at that (lat, lon).
2. **PowerWorld load test:** `TimeStepLoadPWW(file, "Weather Only")` via ESA/SimAuto — exit 0 = file loads cleanly. Pass absolute paths (PowerWorld resolves relative paths against its own working dir). Script: `DrBailey_WRF_pww/pww_powerworld_smoketest.py`.

# Timestep simulation (concept)

## Abstract

A timestep simulation (in this project's sense) is PowerWorld's built-in TimeStep feature run over a weather time series: each renewable generator's hourly solar or wind MW output is computed quasi-statically from PWW weather data via its embedded PFW model. This is not a transient-stability study — it has nothing to do with faults or rotor angles. For how to set one up and run it see [timestep-simulation-setup](../methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md); for the code see time step simulation.

## Content

In **this project's** sense, a "timestep simulation" is a run of PowerWorld's
built-in **TimeStep** feature: a power-system case is stepped through a sequence of
weather timestamps so PowerWorld computes, for each renewable generator, how much
**solar** or **wind** MW it would produce at every hour. This is *not* a
transient-stability / dynamics study and has nothing to do with faults or rotor
angles — it is a quasi-static, hour-by-hour weather-to-generation evaluation.

This page is **what it is**; for **how to set one up and run it** see the method
[timestep-simulation-setup](../methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md); for the engine/code see the project
time step simulation.

## How it works conceptually
1. A weather time series ([pww-data](pww-data.md)) is loaded into the case
   (`TimeStepLoadPWW`).
2. Each renewable generator carries an embedded **PFW (PowerFlow Weather) model**
   that maps weather (irradiance, wind speed, etc.) to MW.
3. PowerWorld walks every timestep, applies the weather, and records each
   generator's output (`TimeStepDoRun`).
4. The result is an hourly MW table per generator, split into solar and wind.

## Why it matters
- Converts gridded weather into grid-relevant generation numbers, hour by hour.
- Lets historical years (ERA5 quarter files) and forecast files alike be turned
  into generation profiles for downstream studies.
- Feeds extreme-scenario and renewable-integration analysis.

## Series vs parallel
The time step simulation project runs it **series** (slow, for testing) and
**parallel** (fast, many sims at once). Output resolution is currently
**generator-level** — area/substation-level aggregation is a noted future extension.

# Concept: The weather-to-MW timestep workflow

## Abstract

The end-to-end chain that turns a weather file into hourly solar and wind output for
every renewable generator in a case: open the case, load a `.pww`, select the renewable
units, tell PowerWorld which fields to save, run its built-in TimeStep simulation, and
export per-generator CSVs. PowerWorld does the weather-to-MW conversion itself using
each unit's embedded PFW model. This is a quasi-static production study, **not** a
transient stability run.

### What it is, and what it is not

PowerWorld's TimeStep feature solves a sequence of independent steady-state points, one
per timestamp. It is a production-cost-style study, not dynamics: there is no swing
equation, no machine model, no sub-second behaviour. If you want transient stability,
that is the `TS*` family of script actions and a completely different setup.

The name collision causes real confusion. "Timestep simulation" here means hourly
snapshots across a weather series.

### The chain

1. **Copy the case to a temporary `.pwb`.** The run mutates the case; work on a copy so
   a failed run does not leave your original in a strange state.
2. **Open it** with `esapp`.
3. **Load weather** with `TimeStepLoadPWW`, or `TimeStepLoadPWWRangeLatLon` to crop to a
   lat/lon box at load time. Append further files with `TimeStepAppendPWW`.
4. **Select the renewable generators** — typically those whose fuel type contains `WND`
   or `SUN`. Only selected units produce output.
5. **Declare the fields to save** with `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet(GEN, ...)`. Fields not
   declared here are simply absent from the results, with no warning.
6. **Run** with `TimeStepDoRun()`. Debug a broken setup with
   `TimeStepDoSinglePoint()` first — it solves one timestamp and fails in seconds
   rather than after a long run.
7. **Export** with `TimeStepSaveResultsByTypeCSV`.

### PowerWorld does the conversion

You do not compute power curves. Each renewable unit carries an embedded **PFW** (Power
Flow Weather) model string, and PowerWorld applies it to convert weather into MW for
that specific unit. Your job is to supply weather and select units; the physics is
already in the case.

If a unit produces nothing, the usual cause is that it has no PFW model rather than
anything wrong with your weather.

**PWW and PFW are different things.** PWW is the weather data file; PFW is the
generator's weather-to-power model. The names are one letter apart and confusing them
wastes an afternoon. See [pww-data](pww-data.md).

### Reading the output

The exported CSVs are not plain tables. Expect **eight metadata header rows** before the
data begins — read past them or every column parses as text. Timestamps commonly need
a timezone conversion, and the natural final step is splitting the table into a solar
file and a wind file.

Details in [how-to-analyze-results](../methods/how-to-analyze-results.md).

### Series and parallel

A series runner processes timestamps one at a time: slow, but its errors are legible.
A parallel runner using a process pool is dramatically faster because each timestamp is
independent, which makes this an unusually clean parallel problem.

Develop against the series runner and switch to parallel for production. Debugging a
process pool that is failing on one timestamp out of eight thousand is a bad way to
spend a day.

### Copper-plate cases

These studies often run on a copper-plate version of the case — transmission constraints
removed — because the question is usually "what could these renewables have produced?"
rather than "what could have been delivered?" See [copper-plate](copper-plate.md).

Deciding which question you are asking, before the run rather than after, saves
rerunning it.

### Granularity

The workflow is generator-level. Aggregating to area or substation is a post-processing
step on the exported CSVs, not something to ask PowerWorld for during the run.

# Concept: PowerWorld version requirements

## Abstract

Which PowerWorld version you need, how to find out which one you have, and what this
knowledge base was verified against. Everything here was tested on **Simulator 24, build
24.2026.7.22** — 13 of 14 feature areas confirmed working. Version matters more than it
looks: field availability and script-action behaviour both shift between releases, and
they shift *silently*.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [preflight-powerworld](../methods/preflight-powerworld.md) · [esapp-environment](esapp-environment.md) · [powerworld-simauto](powerworld-simauto.md) · [glossary](glossary.md)

## Content

### Find your version — three ways

**1. From Python, during preflight** — no admin rights needed:

```python
import win32com.client
from datetime import date, timedelta

sa = win32com.client.Dispatch("pwrworld.SimulatorAuto")
build = date(1899, 12, 30) + timedelta(days=int(sa.RequestBuildDate))
print("PowerWorld build date:", build.isoformat())
```

`RequestBuildDate` is a Delphi serial date — days since 1899-12-30, not a version number.
`46225` decodes to `2026-07-22`.

**2. From the executable** (PowerShell), which gives the real version string:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files\PowerWorld\Simulator*\pwrworld.exe' |
  ForEach-Object { $_.VersionInfo.ProductVersion }
# 24.2026.7.22
```

The format is `<major>.<year>.<month>.<day>` — major version 24, built 2026-07-22.

**3. From the registry**, which also reveals where SimAuto actually points:

```powershell
(Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\pwrworld.SimulatorAuto\CLSID').'(default)'
```

Then look up that CLSID's `LocalServer32` to see the exact `pwrworld.exe` being served.

**Watch for stale registry keys.** A machine can carry `Simulator 22` and `Simulator 23`
keys from previous installs while SimAuto actually serves Simulator 24. The CLSID lookup
is authoritative; the version-numbered keys are not.

### What this kit was verified against

| | |
|---|---|
| **Simulator** | 24, build `24.2026.7.22` |
| **`esapp`** | 0.1.3 |
| **`TeamOverbyeWeather`** | 0.4.0 |
| **Python** | 3.13, 64-bit |
| **Platform** | Windows |

### Feature probe results on that install

| Feature | Pages | Result |
|---|---|---|
| AC power flow | [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md) | OK |
| DC mode | [power-flow-and-sensitivities](../demos/power-flow-and-sensitivities.md) | OK |
| LODF | [lodf](lodf.md) | OK — 89 rows |
| PTDF | [power-flow-and-sensitivities](../demos/power-flow-and-sensitivities.md) | OK — 89 rows |
| Ybus | [esapp](esapp.md) | OK — (37, 37) sparse |
| Jacobian | [esapp](esapp.md) | OK |
| `CTGAutoInsert` | [contingency-and-aux](../demos/contingency-and-aux.md) | OK — 89 contingencies |
| `CTGSolveAll` | [reading-violationctg](../methods/reading-violationctg.md) | OK — 12 violation rows |
| `CreateData` (Branch) | [adding-a-device](../demos/adding-a-device.md) | OK — 89 → 90 |
| `SaveCase` script action | [save-powerworld-case](../methods/save-powerworld-case.md) | OK |
| `LimitSet` `SetData` | [powerworld-limitset-setdata](../methods/powerworld-limitset-setdata.md) | OK |
| GIC | [gic](gic.md) | OK |
| `LoadAux` | [contingency-and-aux](../demos/contingency-and-aux.md) | OK — merged 89 → 94 |
| TimeStep family | [timestep-workflow](timestep-workflow.md) | Prerequisite error on an empty case (expected) |

That last row is worth reading correctly. `TimeStepClearResults` raised
`PowerWorldPrerequisiteError` because there were no TimeStep results to clear — that is
the feature working, not a version problem. Prerequisite errors are about **case state**,
not capability.

### Minimum versions

**Not tested here.** Only Simulator 24 was available, so every claim above is about 24.

What can be said honestly:

- The core surface — power flow, contingency analysis, `CreateData`, `SaveCase`,
  sensitivities, TimeStep, GIC — has been present in Simulator for many releases. It is
  very unlikely you need 24 specifically.
- The [aux-script-commands](../references/aux-script-commands.md) index was compiled against Simulator 24's action set. Older
  releases have fewer actions; newer ones may add some.
- **If you are on an older version and something in this kit fails, the version is a
  plausible cause.** Say so rather than assuming the page is wrong — and if you confirm
  it, that is worth an issue on the repository.

### Version-sensitive behaviour to watch for

These shift between releases and fail *silently*, which is what makes them dangerous:

| Behaviour | Why version matters |
|---|---|
| **Field availability** | A field can exist and return blank in one release and be populated in another. Derived weather fields have done exactly this. Check for all-null columns before trusting any derived field |
| **Script action names and arguments** | Actions are added, and argument lists occasionally change. An unrecognised action is not always a loud failure |
| **Required key fields for `CreateData`** | The required set is version-specific. A call that worked on an older release can silently no-op on a newer one — which is why [adding-a-device](../demos/adding-a-device.md) insists on asserting the object count |
| **Default limit sets and monitoring** | Defaults change, which changes what counts as a violation without changing your code |

### The SimAuto licence is not a version question

Worth separating, because people conflate them: **SimAuto is licensed separately from
Simulator**, and having the newest Simulator does not mean you have automation. A perfect
Simulator 24 install can fail every script in this kit.

On a working install you will see `PWSimAutoService.exe` alongside `pwrworld.exe` in the
Simulator directory, and `Dispatch("pwrworld.SimulatorAuto")` will succeed. If it raises,
see [preflight-powerworld](../methods/preflight-powerworld.md) — no code change fixes a licence.

### What to do at the start of a session

the version is on the record before any analysis is written. If a later result looks
wrong, that line is the first thing to check.
