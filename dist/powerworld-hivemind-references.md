# Reference: PowerWorld SCRIPT actions — working subset

## Abstract

A task-organized index of the PowerWorld SCRIPT actions this kit's workflows actually
use, plus their close neighbours — 198 of the ~370 that Simulator defines. Look
here to find *which* command does a job; look in Simulator's own *Auxiliary File Format*
manual for argument lists and exact syntax, which this page deliberately does not
reproduce. Every command runs the same way: `pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("ActionName(args)")`,
or inside a `SCRIPT { }` block in an `.aux` file. Start at [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md) for the
Python side.

## Content

> authority. Where this page and the manual disagree, the manual is right.

### How a script action is invoked

```python
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand('SolvePowerFlow(RECTNEWT)')
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand('SaveCase("C:\\out\\case.pwb", PWB, YES)')
```

Two rules that cause most first-attempt failures, both documented at
[save-powerworld-case](../methods/save-powerworld-case.md) and [new-device-contingency-aux](../methods/new-device-contingency-aux.md):

- File paths must be **absolute**. A relative path resolves against Simulator's current
  working directory, which is not your script's.
- `LoadAux` **merges** into the open case rather than replacing it. Loading the same aux
  twice duplicates its objects.

### Opening, saving, and case lifecycle

| Action | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `OpenCase` | Open a `.pwb` from disk, replacing whatever is loaded |
| `NewCase` | Start from an empty case |
| `AppendCase` | Merge a second case into the open one |
| `SaveCase` | Write the case to disk. **Use this, not the COM `SaveCase`** — see [save-powerworld-case](../methods/save-powerworld-case.md) |
| `EnterMode` | Switch between `RUN` and `EDIT`. Many data writes are rejected outside `EDIT` |
| `Scale` | Scale load, generation, or injection by a factor or to a target total |
| `Equivalence` | Reduce the case to an equivalent of the retained subsystem |
| `DeleteExternalSystem` | Drop everything outside the retained area/zone selection |
| `SaveExternalSystem` | Write the external subsystem out separately |
| `LoadEMS` | Read an EMS-format snapshot |
| `RenumberBuses` | Renumber buses en masse — changes key fields, so re-read any DataFrame you held |
| `RenumberAreas`, `RenumberZones`, `RenumberSubs` | Same, for those container types |
| `RenumberCase` | Apply a renumbering scheme across the whole case |
| `Renumber3WXFormerStarBuses` | Renumber the hidden star buses inside three-winding transformers |
| `CaseDescriptionSet`, `CaseDescriptionClear` | Set or clear the case's description text |

### Reading and writing data

| Action | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `SetData` | Write field values on existing objects. **Requires the entire key-field row** or it errors — see [powerworld-limitset-setdata](../methods/powerworld-limitset-setdata.md) |
| `CreateData` | Create new objects (buses, branches, loads, generators) — see [adding-devices-esapp](../methods/adding-devices-esapp.md) |
| `SetElseCreateData` | Set one object's fields if it exists, else create it from defaults. The aux language's only exists-check — see [aux-only-powerworld](../concepts/aux-only-powerworld.md). Added September 2026; older Simulator 24 builds will not have it |
| `Delete` | Delete objects of a type matching a filter |
| `DeleteDevice` | Delete one specific device |
| `DeleteIncludingContents` | Delete a container and everything inside it |
| `LoadAux` | Read an `.aux` file into the case. Absolute path; **merges** |
| `LoadAuxDirectory` | Load every aux in a directory |
| `LoadCSV`, `LoadData`, `ImportData` | Bulk-import records from CSV or another data source |
| `LoadScript` | Run a named `SCRIPT` block from an aux file |
| `SaveData` | Export a table of objects and chosen fields to file |
| `SaveDataWithExtra` | Same, with additional computed columns |
| `SaveDataUsingBuiltInAUXFormat` | Export as aux using Simulator's own field layout |
| `SaveDataUsingExportFormat` | Export using a named custom format |
| `SaveDataEPC` | Export in EPC format |
| `SaveObjectFields` | Write out which fields exist for an object type |
| `SelectAll`, `UnSelectAll` | Set or clear the `Selected` flag, which many other actions filter on |
| `SendtoExcel` | Push a table to Excel. Note the lowercase `t` — the obvious spelling fails |
| `WriteLimitMonitoringSettings` | Dump the current limit-monitoring configuration |

### Solving power flow

| Action | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `SolvePowerFlow` | Solve. Takes the method: `RECTNEWT`, `POLARNEWT`, `GAUSSSEIDEL`, `FASTDEC`, `DC` |
| `ResetToFlatStart` | Reset voltages to 1.0 pu / 0 degrees before a hard solve |
| `EstimateVoltages` | Seed a starting voltage profile when flat start will not converge |
| `ZeroOutMismatches` | Force mismatches to zero — diagnostic, not a fix |
| `UpdateIslandsAndBusStatus` | Recompute island membership and energization after topology edits |
| `VoltageConditioning`, `ConditionVoltagePockets` | Repair local voltage anomalies that block convergence |
| `InitializeGenMvarLimits` | Reset generator reactive limits to their defined values |
| `GenForceLDC_RCC` | Force line-drop / reactive-current compensation behaviour |
| `SaveJacobian` | Write the Jacobian matrix to file |
| `SaveYbusInMatlabFormat` | Write Ybus in MATLAB format |
| `StoreState`, `RestoreState`, `DeleteState` | Snapshot and roll back a solved state. Cheaper than reloading the case between scenarios |
| `ClearPowerFlowSolutionAidValues` | Clear stored solution aids |

**A DC solve always reports zero mismatch.** It cannot tell you that your generation
schedule is short — the slack bus absorbs it silently. Check the schedule against total
load directly. See [applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case](../methods/applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case.md).

### Contingency analysis

| Action | What it is for |

| `CTGRestoreReference` | Return the case to its pre-contingency reference state |
| `CTGSetAsReference` | Mark the current state as the reference base |
| `CTGClearAllResults` | Clear stored results. **Do this first** — results persist stale inside the `.pwb`, see [reading-violationctg](../methods/reading-violationctg.md) |
| `CTGProduceReport` | Write a formatted violation report |
| `CTGSaveViolationMatrices` | Export the violation matrices |
| `CTGWriteResultsAndOptions` | Write results plus the option set that produced them |

| `CTGSort` | Sort the contingency list |
| `CTGCloneOne`, `CTGCloneMany` | Duplicate contingency definitions |
| `CTGDeleteWithIdenticalActions`, `CTGSkipWithIdenticalActions` | Remove or skip duplicates by action set |
| `CTGConvertAllToDeviceCTG`, `CTGConvertToPrimaryCTG` | Convert between contingency representations |
| `CTGCreateStuckBreakerCTGs`, `CTGCreateExpandedBreakerCTGs` | Build breaker-failure contingencies |
| `CTGCreateContingentInterfaces` | Create interfaces defined by contingency outcomes |
| `CTGRelinkUnlinkedElements` | Re-bind contingency elements whose keys stopped resolving |
| `CTGJoinActiveCTGs` | Combine active contingencies into one |
| `CTGComboSolveAll`, `CTGComboDeleteAllResults` | Solve or clear combination contingencies |
| `CTGCalculateOTDF` | Outage transfer distribution factors |
| `CTGCompareTwoListsofContingencyResults` | Diff two result sets |
| `CTGProcessRemedialActionsAndDependencies` | Evaluate remedial action schemes |
| `CTGVerifyIteratedLinearActions` | Validate iterated linear contingency actions |
| `CTGReadFilePTI`, `CTGReadFilePSLF`, `CTGWriteFilePTI` | Exchange contingency sets with PSS/E and PSLF |
| `CTGWriteAllOptions` | Dump every contingency analysis option |
| `DoCTGAction` | Execute a single contingency action directly |

Building a contingency set for a chosen device list is its own procedure with several
silent failure modes (`ElementType=GEN` is ignored; the action string must be quoted;
labels get whitespace-trimmed on load) — see [new-device-contingency-aux](../methods/new-device-contingency-aux.md).

| `TimeStepLoadTSB`, `TimeStepLoadB3D` | Load time-series data in TSB or B3D format |
| `TimeStepDoRun` | Run the full time-step simulation |
| `TimeStepDoSinglePoint` | Solve one time point only — use this to debug setup before a long run |
| `TimeStepClearResults`, `TimeStepDeleteAll` | Clear results, or clear the whole time-step definition |

### What this page leaves out

Simulator defines roughly 370 SCRIPT actions. Omitted here as outside this kit's scope:
oneline and user-interface actions, fault analysis, ATC, integrated topology processing,
regions, scheduled actions, distributed computing, the trainer, and customer-specific
actions. If you need one of those, the *Auxiliary File Format* manual lists them by the
same category names used above.

# ESA++ (esapp) — Package Backend / Internals Reference

## Abstract

Internals reference for the esapp package project, covering bracket-interface mechanics (`Indexable.__getitem__`/`__setitem__`), SAW mixin composition, the component-generation pipeline, GObject schema model, embedded utility apps (`Network`, `GIC`, `BusCat`), descriptors, and the exception hierarchy. This is the heavy/deep layer — read it in full only when writing or regenerating code for esapp package; for the gist, use the project page.

## Connections

- **Up:** esapp package (the project) + [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md) (API-usage map for callers), [powerworld-simauto](../concepts/powerworld-simauto.md), aux script catalog (raw SCRIPT-command name index)

## Content

**Scope:** how `esapp` works *inside* and how to *extend* it — bracket-interface
mechanics, the SAW mixin assembly, the component-generation pipeline, the GObject
schema model, embedded utility apps, descriptors, and the exception hierarchy. This
is the INTERNALS companion to the API-usage map in [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md); it does not re-document
user-facing call recipes. Project status/tracker lives at esapp package; hub is
[Home](../index.md).

All file:line citations are against the real source under `C:\path\to\esapp`.

---

## 1. Object graph (who owns whom)

```
PowerWorld(Indexable)            workbench.py:22   — user entry point
 ├── .esa : SAW                  set in Indexable.open() indexable.py:50
 │    └── SAW(SAWBase, *mixins)  saw/saw.py:28      — ~20 mixins composed
 ├── .network : Network(self)    workbench.py:36    — utils/network.py
 ├── .gic     : GIC(self)        workbench.py:37    — utils/gic.py
 └── .buscat  : BusCat(self)     workbench.py:38    — utils/buscat.py
```

`PowerWorld` **subclasses** `Indexable` (so `pw[...]` works directly), and **holds**
a `SAW` instance as `self.esa`. The embedded apps each keep a back-reference to the
`PowerWorld` instance (`self._pw`) and delegate all data access through it — they
never open their own COM connection.

`PowerWorld.__init__` (workbench.py:26–45) instantiates the three apps *first*, then
either opens the case (`self.open()`, inherited from `Indexable`) or leaves
`self.esa = None`. `Indexable.open()` (indexable.py:25–50) absolutizes/validates the
path and constructs `SAW(self.fname, CreateIfNotFound=True, early_bind=True)` — note
**`CreateIfNotFound=True` is hard-wired here**, which is what makes the bracket-write
create path possible (see §3).

---

## 2. `Indexable` — bracket read/write mechanics

File: `esapp/indexable.py`. `Indexable` is a mixin-style base with two declared
attributes (`esa: SAW`, `fname: str`) and the bracket protocol. Both `PowerWorld`
and `SAW` are described as implementing indexable access, but the read/write logic
lives here and is backed by SAW data methods.

### 2.1 `__getitem__` (read) — indexable.py:52–113

Index forms and how they resolve:

| Index | `requested_fields` | Fields fetched |
|---|---|---|
| `pw[Bus]` | `None` | `set(gtype.keys())` only |
| `pw[Bus, :]` | `slice(None)` | keys ∪ `gtype.fields()` (all) |
| `pw[Bus, "BusPUVolt"]` | str | keys ∪ {field} |
| `pw[Bus, ["a","b"]]` | list | keys ∪ {a,b} |
| `pw[Bus, Bus.PUVolt]` | a `GObject` member | uses `field.value[1]` (the PW field string) |

Mechanics (verbatim flow):
1. Unpack `index` into `(gtype, requested_fields)` (tuple) or `(gtype, None)`.
2. `fields_to_get = set(gtype.keys())` — **always starts from primary keys.**
3. A bare `GObject` member in the field list is resolved via `field.value[1]`
   (the field-name string carried in the enum value tuple — see §5).
4. A `slice` other than `[:]` raises `ValueError("Only the full slice [:] is
   supported...")`.
5. Returns `self.esa.GetParamsRectTyped(gtype.TYPE(), sorted(list(fields_to_get)))`.

So **every read is backed by `SAW.GetParamsRectTyped`** (data.py:324–362), which
calls COM `GetParamsRectTyped` with `pythoncom.VT_VARIANT` to preserve native typing,
and returns a `DataFrame(output, columns=ParamList)` or `None`. Fields are passed
**sorted**, so column order in the returned DataFrame is alphabetical, not request
order.

### 2.2 `__setitem__` (write) — indexable.py:115–173

Two dispatch cases:

- **Case 1 — bulk** `pw[GObject] = DataFrame`: `args` is a `type` subclassing
  `GObject` → `_bulk_update_from_df(args, value)`.
- **Case 2 — broadcast** `pw[GObject, field(s)] = value`: `args` is a 2-tuple →
  normalizes `fields` to a list and calls `_broadcast_update_to_fields(gtype, fields, value)`.
- Anything else → `TypeError`.

### 2.3 `_bulk_update_from_df` — indexable.py:148–197 (the create path)

This is the load-bearing method. Flow **as of 0.2.1** (line numbers against the 0.2.1
`indexable.py`; the 0.1.x layout this section used to describe is noted inline):

1. Reject non-DataFrame `value` with `TypeError`.
2. **The write funnel:** `df = self._prepare_write(gtype, df)` (`:212`) — normalizes
   `GObject`-member columns to field-name strings, calls `_warn_unsettable` (`:199`), then
   `_serialize_bools` (`:226`). The caller's DataFrame is never mutated.

   > ⚠️ **This is no longer a gate.** Through 0.1.x it was: a read-only column raised
   > `ValueError("Cannot set read-only field(s)...")` *before* any COM call, so esapp never
   > asked PowerWorld. In 0.2.1 `_warn_unsettable` only emits `warnings.warn` — once for
   > unknown fields, once for read-only ones — and **the write proceeds regardless**, on the
   > stated principle that "PowerWorld is the authority, and the generated schema may lag the
   > installed Simulator version." Consequences: a field-name typo no longer raises, and the
   > read-only warning is a false alarm on ~150 fields (§5).

   `is_settable` = key ∪ secondary ∪ editable (see §5).
3. Fast path: `self._send_rect(gtype, df)` (`:274`) →
   `self.esa.ChangeParametersMultipleElementRect(gtype.TYPE(), df.columns.tolist(), df)` —
   one COM round-trip (data.py:88–121). A `PowerWorldError` here is re-raised through
   `_raise_with_edit_hint` (`:263`), which appends *"field(s) [...] are only enterable in
   EDIT mode — call esa.EnterMode('EDIT') first"* when any touched field carries the
   `EDIT_MODE` flag.
4. **Create fallback keyed off the exception type:** wrapped in
   `except PowerWorldPrerequisiteError as e:` and `if "not found" in str(e).lower():`
   - Check `gtype.key_sets()` — the primary keys first, then any `ALT_KEY_SETS` alternates
     registered for the type. If **no** complete key set is a subset of `df.columns` →
     `ValueError` naming the missing fields and every accepted key set. (0.1.x compared
     against `gtype.keys()` alone; alternate key sets are new.) Secondary keys are *not*
     required.
   - Else fall back to `ChangeParametersMultipleElement(type, cols, values)` (the
     row-by-row variant, data.py:54–86), which **creates** objects when
     `CreateIfNotFound=True` **and** PowerWorld is in **EDIT mode**. A second
     `"not found"` `PowerWorldPrerequisiteError` from this call is **swallowed**
     (expected for freshly created rows); any other message re-raises.
   - Any non-`"not found"` `PowerWorldPrerequisiteError` re-raises immediately.

This is the concrete answer to "where bracket-write keys off `PowerWorldPrerequisiteError`":
indexable.py:233–253. The classification "not found" → `PowerWorldPrerequisiteError`
is decided in `PowerWorldError.from_message` (see §6); the bracket layer then string-matches
`"not found"` again to distinguish the create case from other prerequisite failures.

> Prerequisites for the create path to actually create: `SAW(..., CreateIfNotFound=True)`
> (already forced by `Indexable.open()`, indexable.py:50) **and** `pw.edit_mode()`
> (`esa.EnterMode('EDIT')`, workbench.py:427–429) before assignment.

### 2.4 `_broadcast_update_to_fields` — indexable.py:255–316

For `pw[GObject, fields] = value`. Same settable gate first. Then two sub-paths:

- **Keyless object** (`not gtype.keys()`, e.g. `Sim_Solution_Options`): builds the
  change DataFrame directly from `value` without reading PowerWorld. Single field →
  `{field: [value]}`; multiple fields require `value` to be a list/tuple of equal
  length (else `ValueError`).
- **Keyed object:** reads existing primary keys via `self[gtype, keys]` (a recursive
  `__getitem__`), returns early if empty (nothing to update — **never creates** on
  this path), then assigns `change_df[field] = value` (pandas broadcasts a scalar or
  aligns a list/array). Single field uses the bare name to avoid pandas multi-column
  treatment.

Always finishes with `ChangeParametersMultipleElementRect`. So broadcast writes are
update-only; only the Case-1 DataFrame path can create.

`fexcept` (indexable.py:11) is a small lambda turning `'Three…'` type names into
`'3…'` (e.g. `ThreeWindingTransformer` → `3WindingTransformer`) — Python-identifier
vs PowerWorld-string reconciliation, mirrored in the generator (§4).

---

## 3. SAW mixin composition — `esapp/saw/saw.py`

`SAW` is an **empty class body** (`pass`) whose entire behavior comes from its MRO.
saw.py:28–55:

```python
class SAW(
    SAWBase,           # core COM: __init__, _com_call, RunScriptCommand, exec_aux...
    CaseActionsMixin, DataMixin, ContingencyMixin, GeneralMixin, MatrixMixin,
    ModifyMixin, PowerflowMixin, RegionsMixin, SensitivityMixin, ScheduledActionsMixin,
    TopologyMixin, TransientMixin, FaultMixin, ATCMixin, GICMixin, OPFMixin,
    PVMixin, QVMixin, TimeStepMixin, WeatherMixin,
):
    pass
```

21 bases total (`SAWBase` + 20 functional mixins). Each mixin lives in its own
`esapp/saw/<area>.py` and is imported at the top of saw.py:5–25.

### How a mixin works (the shared contract)

Mixins do **not** declare `__init__` or hold state — they rely on `SAWBase`
providing:
- `self._com_call(func, *args)` — the single COM gateway (base.py:331–401). Wraps
  every SimAuto call, unwraps the `(Error, Result)` tuple, maps RPC failures to
  `COMError`, and raises `PowerWorldError.from_message(...)` when SimAuto returns an
  error string. Returns `output[1]` (single result) or `output[1:]`.
- `self._run_script(command, *args)` — builds a script statement `"Cmd(a, b);"`
  (strips trailing `None`s, stringifies args) and routes through `RunScriptCommand`
  (base.py:202–238). This is how every *script-command* mixin method works.
- `self.log`, `self.decimal_delimiter`, `self._object_fields` (field-list cache),
  `self.pw_order`, etc.

Two concrete patterns to copy when extending:

- **Script-command method** (most analysis verbs) — `PowerflowMixin.SolvePowerFlow`
  (powerflow.py:10–40): normalize an enum/str arg, then
  `return self._run_script("SolvePowerFlow", method)`.
  `TimeStepMixin` (timestep.py) is the cleanest example: nearly every method is a
  one-line `self._run_script("TimeStep…", …)` with filename/time args quoted.
- **Data method** (typed COM data calls) — `DataMixin` (data.py): convert lists/DFs
  to COM variants (`convert_list_to_variant`, `convert_df_to_variant`) and call
  `self._com_call("GetParamsRectTyped", …)`.

### How to add a mixin (extension recipe)

1. Create `esapp/saw/<feature>.py` with `class FeatureMixin:` and methods that use
   `self._run_script(...)` (for script commands) or `self._com_call(...)` (for direct
   SimAuto functions). No `__init__`, no state of your own.
2. Import it in `saw/saw.py` (top, alongside the others) and add it to the `SAW(...)`
   base list. **MRO order matters** only if two mixins define the same method name —
   keep `SAWBase` first and avoid name collisions.
3. If the feature needs new type-safe constants, add them to `saw/_enums.py` and
   export via `saw/__init__.py`'s `__all__`.

No registry/metaclass — composition is purely the explicit base-class tuple, so the
only "wiring" is the import + the line in the tuple.

---

## 4. Component generation pipeline — `esapp/components/`

`grid.py` (~13 MB) and `ts_fields.py` are **auto-generated** from the `PWRaw` TSV
schema export. Do **not** hand-edit them (the file banner says so, and the project
conventions in esapp package reiterate it). Regenerate with:

```bash
cd esapp/components && python generate_components.py   # reads ./PWRaw
```

`generate_components.py:490–507` (the `__main__`): builds a `ComponentGenerator('PWRaw')`,
calls `.parse()`, then `.generate_components('grid.py')` and `.generate_ts_fields('ts_fields.py')`.

### Pipeline stages (`ComponentGenerator`)

1. **Row iteration** — `_iter_raw_rows` (337–341) skips the header and joins wrapped
   quoted continuation lines via `_join_continuation_lines` (343–362). A line is a
   field row if it starts with a tab (`_is_field_row`, 369–370); an object header is
   detected by `_is_object_header` (372–380) using the subdata/maintainer columns.
2. **Parse** — `_parse_components` (150–171) walks rows, creating an
   `ObjectTypeDefinition` per header (skipping `EXCLUDE_OBJECTS`, 79–92) and appending
   `FieldDefinition`s (skipping `EXCLUDE_FIELDS` and any var name containing `/`).
   `_parse_field_definition` (382–397) reads columns: var name (col 3), key symbol
   (col 2), concise name (4), data type (5), description (6), enterable (8).
3. **Key-symbol → role** — `_parse_key_symbol` (446–459) maps PWRaw symbols to
   `FieldRole` flags: `*`→PRIMARY_KEY, `*1*/*2*/*3*`→COMPOSITE_KEY_n, `*2B*`→SECONDARY_ID,
   `*4B*`→CIRCUIT_ID, `*A*`→ALTERNATE_KEY, `**`→BASE_VALUE, `<`→STANDARD_FIELD.
   `FieldDefinition.is_primary` (39–45) treats PRIMARY/COMPOSITE_n/SECONDARY_ID/CIRCUIT_ID
   as primary; `is_secondary` (47–51) = ALTERNATE_KEY|BASE_VALUE.
4. **Name sanitizing** — `_sanitize_for_python` (420–426): `:`→`__`, space→`___`,
   leading digit handling (`3…`→`Three…`, else prefix `_`). `_fix_pw_string` (428–436)
   is the inverse used to recover the PowerWorld field string. (This is the same
   `Three…`↔`3…` rule as `fexcept` in indexable.py.)
5. **Emit GObject classes** — `generate_components` (233–262): writes the preamble
   `from .gobject import *`, then per object a `class <Name>(GObject):` with members
   `PyName = ("PWFieldString", <dtype>, <FieldPriority flags>)` plus a docstring, and
   finally `ObjectString = '<full obj name>'`. Fields are sorted by `_get_sort_key`
   (468–477: composite/primary keys first, then alternate, secondary, base value,
   then standard). Priority flags built by `_build_field_priority_flags` (479–487):
   PRIMARY → `FieldPriority.PRIMARY`, secondary → `FieldPriority.SECONDARY`, else
   `FieldPriority.OPTIONAL`; `+ REQUIRED` if base value; `+ EDITABLE` if enterable.

Real generated output (`grid.py:6036–6048`):
```python
class Bus(GObject):
	BusNum = ("BusNum", int, FieldPriority.PRIMARY)
	"""Number"""
	BusName_NomVolt = ("BusName_NomVolt", str, FieldPriority.SECONDARY)
	"""Name_Nominal kV"""
	AreaNum = ("AreaNum", int, FieldPriority.SECONDARY | FieldPriority.REQUIRED | FieldPriority.EDITABLE)
	...
```

6. **TS fields** — `_extract_ts_fields` (173–231) matches var-name prefixes from
   `TS_OBJECT_MAPPING` (128–138: `TSBus`→`Bus`, `TSGen`→`Gen`, `TSACLine`→`Branch`,
   …), strips `:N` index suffixes, dedups per object type, and emits a frozen
   `TSField` dataclass per attribute under nested `class <ObjType>:` inside one `TS`
   class (generate_ts_fields, 264–333). `TSField.__getitem__` (300–302) lets you write
   `TS.Bus.Input[1]` → `TSField("TSBusInput:1")`.

`MANUAL_FIELDS` (101–124) injects fields PWRaw defines poorly (e.g. `Dbd:3` on
`PlantController_REPCA1`), merged in by `_fields_with_manual_fields` (399–411) without
clobbering existing names.

### `components/__init__.py`
Re-exports: `GObject` from `gobject`, `from .grid import *` (all object classes), and
`TS, TSField` from `ts_fields`.

---

## 5. `GObject` schema model — `esapp/components/gobject.py`

`GObject(Enum)` builds a class-level schema at *definition time* via a custom
`__new__` (gobject.py:59–106). Each subclass member is either:
- the **type tag** — a single-arg member (`ObjectString = 'Bus'`) → sets `cls._TYPE`
  and stores an int `_value_`; or
- a **field** — a `(name, dtype, priority)` triple → `_value_` becomes the 4-tuple
  `(int, field_name_str, dtype, priority)`, and the field name is appended to the
  per-class lists `_FIELDS`, plus `_KEYS`/`_SECONDARY`/`_EDITABLE` depending on its
  `FieldPriority` flags (95–104).

This is why `__getitem__` can read `field.value[1]` for a member (indexable.py:102) —
index 1 of the tuple is the PowerWorld field-name string.

`FieldPriority(Flag)` (gobject.py:16–28): `PRIMARY`, `SECONDARY`, `REQUIRED`,
`OPTIONAL`, `EDITABLE`, **`EDIT_MODE`** — combinable. `EDIT_MODE` marks a field only
enterable while Simulator is in EDIT mode and drives the hint in `_raise_with_edit_hint`
(§2.3).

### Classmethod schema accessors (the public extension surface)

| Classmethod | Returns | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `TYPE()` | PW object-type string (e.g. `"Bus"`), or `'NO_OBJECT_NAME'` | 220 |
| `keys()` | primary-key field names (`_KEYS`) | 172 |
| `fields()` | all field names (`_FIELDS`) | 176 |
| `secondary()` | secondary-key field names (`_SECONDARY`) | 180 |
| `editable()` | editable field names (`_EDITABLE`) | 185 |
| `edit_mode_only()` | fields needing EDIT mode (`_EDIT_MODE`) | 189 |
| `is_edit_mode_only(f)` | bool — in `_EDIT_MODE` | 194 |
| `key_sets()` | `[frozenset(keys())]` + `ALT_KEY_SETS[TYPE()]` alternates | 199 |
| `identifiers()` | `set(keys) ∪ set(secondary)` | 210 |
| `settable()` | `identifiers() ∪ set(editable)` | 215 |
| `is_editable(f)` | bool — in `_EDITABLE` | 224 |
| `is_settable(f)` | bool — in `settable()` | 229 |

`keys()` drives the always-included primary keys in reads; `key_sets()` (with the
`ALT_KEY_SETS` table at gobject.py:61) drives the create-path key check in §2.3.

> ⚠️ **`is_settable` is advisory, not a gate, and it is frequently wrong.** Through 0.1.x
> it *was* the gate — both bracket-write paths refused a read-only column. In 0.2.1 it only

`__str__` returns the PW field string for field members (so a member stringifies to
its PowerWorld name); `__repr__` shows the type or field for debugging (108–120).

## 6. Exception hierarchy — `esapp/saw/_exceptions.py`

```
Exception
└── Error                         (base for everything esapp; _exceptions.py:8)
    ├── PowerWorldError           (SimAuto returned an error string; 19)
    │   ├── SimAutoFeatureError           ("cannot be retrieved through simauto"; 77)
    │   ├── PowerWorldPrerequisiteError   (setup/data missing — KEY for writes; 92)
    │   ├── PowerWorldAddonError          ("not registered"; 108)
    │   └── CommandNotRespectedError      (silent no-op; 135)
    ├── COMError                  (COM/RPC layer failure; 121)

    │   ├── BifurcationException / DivergenceException / GeneratorLimitException
    └── GICException              (204)
```

### The classification factory — `PowerWorldError.from_message` (50–74)

`SAWBase._com_call` raises `PowerWorldError.from_message(output[0])` when SimAuto
returns a non-empty, non-"No data" error string (base.py:386–387). The factory
lower-cases the message and returns a **subclass**:
- `"cannot be retrieved through simauto"` → `SimAutoFeatureError`.
- Any of `"no active"`, **`"not found"`**, `"could not be found"`, `"requires setup"`,
  `"is not online"`, `"at least one"`, `"no directions set"`, `"out-of-range"`,
  `"no available participation points"` → `PowerWorldPrerequisiteError`.
- `"not registered"` → `PowerWorldAddonError`.
- else → base `PowerWorldError`.

This is the linchpin for bracket-write: a SimAuto "object not found" comes back as
`PowerWorldPrerequisiteError`, which `_bulk_update_from_df` catches and re-string-matches
on `"not found"` to trigger the create fallback (§2.3). So the create path depends on
**both** the factory's substring list *and* the bracket layer's own `"not found"` check.

`COMError` is different in kind — it wraps a thrown COM exception (RPC server crash /
invalid function), raised in `_com_call`'s `except` (base.py:368–376), not via the
factory.

`__init__` (38–48) splits the message on the first `:` into `source` / `message`,
keeping `raw_message`.

The exception classes consolidated from the old `utils/exceptions.py` (`GridObjDNE`,
`PowerFlowException` & subtypes, `GICException`, etc.) now live in this same file and
are re-exported through `saw/__init__.py` and the top-level `esapp/__init__.py`.

---

## 7. Descriptors — `esapp/_descriptors.py`

Two descriptor classes give Pythonic option access without boilerplate, both built on
the bracket interface:

- **`SolverOption(key, is_bool=True)`** (_descriptors.py:12–34): maps a `PowerWorld`
  attribute to a `Sim_Solution_Options` field. `__get__` does
  `obj[Sim_Solution_Options, key][key].iloc[0]` and coerces to bool via `== YesNo.YES`;
  `__set__` does `obj[Sim_Solution_Options, key] = YesNo.from_bool(value)` (or raw
  value if `is_bool=False`). The ~25 `pw.flat_start`, `pw.max_iterations`, etc. in
  workbench.py:50–93 are instances of this — they read/write through `__setitem__`'s
  keyless broadcast path (§2.4).
- **`GICOption(key, is_bool=True)`** (_descriptors.py:37–68): maps a `GIC` attribute to
  a `GIC_Options_Value` row. `__get__` reads `obj._pw[GIC_Options_Value, "ValueField"]`
  and filters by `VariableName == key`; `__set__` wraps the write in
  `EnterMode("EDIT")` … `SetData('GIC_Options_Value', ['VariableName','ValueField'],
  [key, value])` … `EnterMode("RUN")`. The `pf_include`, `calc_mode`, `efield_mag`, …
  attributes in gic.py:69–96 are instances.

To add a new solver/GIC flag: just declare one more class attribute
`my_opt = SolverOption('PWFieldName')` on `PowerWorld` (or `GICOption(...)` on `GIC`) —
no method needed.

---

## 8. Embedded utility apps — `esapp/utils/`

All three follow the same pattern: `__init__(self, pw=None)` stores `self._pw`, and
every method reaches data via `self._pw[GObject, fields]` or `self._pw.esa.<saw method>`.
They are stateless wrappers over the live case (plus some cached matrices).

- **`Network`** (network.py:62) — topology matrices. `busmap()` (Series BusNum→index),
  `incidence()` (signed branch×bus sparse, HVDC appended, cached in `self._A`),
  `laplacian(weights)` = `A.T @ diags(W) @ A`, plus electrical helpers `lengths`,
  `zmag`, `ybranch`, `yshunt`, `gamma`, `delay`. Pulls `Branch`/`Bus`/`Substation`/
  `DCTransmissionLine` via the bracket interface; `delay()` also calls
  `self._pw.esa.get_ybus()` directly (MatrixMixin). `PowerWorld.busmap/buscoords`
  delegate here (workbench.py:245–275).
- **`GIC`** (gic.py:34) — GIC engine integration. `configure()` sets the `GICOption`
  descriptors; `gmatrix()` forces `pf_include=True` then `self._pw.esa.get_gmatrix()`;
  `storm()` → `esa.GICCalculate(...)`; `model()` (gic.py:250–373) builds the full
  sparse incidence `A`, conductance Laplacian `G`, H-matrix and per-unit `zeta`
  entirely from `GICXFormer`/`Substation`/`Bus`/`Branch`/`Gen` bracket reads. Results
  exposed as read-only properties (`A`, `G`, `H`, `zeta`, `Px`, `eff`).
- **`BusCat`** (buscat.py) — parses the `BusCat` string field into typed bus
  classes/roles using `BusType`/`BusCtrl`/`Role` enums from `saw/_enums.py`; reads
  `Bus` via `self._pw`.

To add another embedded app: write `class Foo: def __init__(self, pw=None): self._pw = pw`
in `utils/`, then add `self.foo = Foo(self)` in `PowerWorld.__init__` (workbench.py:36–38).

# Reference: esapp object-field schema + SimAuto command catalog

## Abstract

This is the field-schema + SimAuto-command lookup for **writing esapp code**: read
it when you need an object type's exact **key fields** (so a read-modify-write
round-trips) or the **command/method** for an operation. **Part A** documents the
`GObject` category model (keys / secondary / editable / identifiers / settable) plus
its runtime `@classmethod` accessors and the real per-type key/identifier table pulled
from `grid.py`. **Part B** catalogs the `SAW` mixins and the named SAW methods; the
task-organized SCRIPT-command index lives in aux script catalog. Every field name and method below was read
out of `C:\path\to\esapp` source — cited `file:line`.

---

## Part A — Object field schema

### A.1 The category model (`components/gobject.py`)

Each component is a `GObject` subclass (an `Enum`). Every field is declared as
`Member = ("PWFieldName", dtype, FieldPriority...)`. The `FieldPriority` `Flag`
(`gobject.py:16-27`) drives which category a field lands in:

| Flag | Meaning (`gobject.py:23-27`) |
|---|---|
| `PRIMARY` | Field is part of the **primary key** for the object |
| `SECONDARY` | Field is part of a **secondary key** (a secondary identifier) |
| `REQUIRED` | Required for data retrieval/update |
| `OPTIONAL` | Optional |
| `EDITABLE` | User-modifiable |

At class-construction time `GObject.__new__` (`gobject.py:59-106`) sorts every field
into class-level lists: `_FIELDS` (all), `_KEYS` (has `PRIMARY`), `_SECONDARY`
(has `SECONDARY`), `_EDITABLE` (has `EDITABLE`). Flags combine with `|`
(e.g. `SECONDARY | REQUIRED | EDITABLE`).

### A.2 Runtime accessors (call with `()` — they are `@classmethod`s)

From `gobject.py:122-161`. **They are methods, not properties — `Bus.keys()` not
`Bus.keys`.**

| Accessor | Returns | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `Type.TYPE()` | PowerWorld object-type string (e.g. `"Bus"`) | `gobject.py:149-151` |
| `Type.fields()` | `list` — every defined field name | `gobject.py:126-128` |
| `Type.keys()` | `list` — **primary** key fields only | `gobject.py:122-124` |
| `Type.secondary()` | `list` — secondary identifier fields | `gobject.py:130-133` |
| `Type.editable()` | `list` — editable (user-modifiable) fields | `gobject.py:135-137` |
| `Type.identifiers()` | `set` — **primary ∪ secondary** keys | `gobject.py:139-142` |
| `Type.settable()` | `set` — **identifiers ∪ editable** (everything writable) | `gobject.py:144-147` |
| `Type.is_editable(name)` | `bool` — is this field editable | `gobject.py:153-156` |
| `Type.is_settable(name)` | `bool` — is this field a key or editable | `gobject.py:158-161` |

```python
from esapp.components import Bus, Gen
Bus.TYPE()          # 'Bus'
Bus.keys()          # ['BusNum']
Gen.keys()          # ['BusNum', 'GenID']
Gen.identifiers()   # primary + secondary, e.g. {'BusNum','GenID','GenStatus','GenMWSetPoint', ...}
Gen.is_settable('GenMW')   # True  -> safe to push back
```

### A.3 The KEY-FIELD WRITE-BACK RULE (do not skip)

PowerWorld matches each DataFrame row back to a live object by its **primary key
field(s)**. If a row you write lacks those keys, PowerWorld cannot identify the object
and the change is a **silent no-op** (no error, no change).

- **Bracket path (preferred):** `pw[Gen, "GenMW"]` *automatically* includes the keys
  on read (`indexable.py:84-89` — reads always start with `gtype.keys()`), so a
  read-modify-write keeps them. A bulk write `pw[Gen] = df` **validates that all
  primary keys are present** and raises `ValueError` if any are missing
  (`indexable.py:235-241`). Every column must also pass `gtype.is_settable(...)`
  (`indexable.py:224-225`).
- **Raw `esa`/SAW path:** you must prepend the keys yourself — there is no auto-key on
  `GetParametersMultipleElement` / `ChangeParametersMultipleElementRect`. Build the
  field list as `list(Gen.keys()) + [<your fields>]` and keep the key columns in the
  DataFrame end-to-end.

**Rule of thumb: never strip key columns from a DataFrame you intend to push back.**

### A.4 Per-type key / identifier table (read from `grid.py`)

Keys/secondary verbatim from the `FieldPriority.PRIMARY` / `.SECONDARY` flags in
`grid.py`. `secondary` here lists the most useful identifiers (full list via
`Type.secondary()`); `#flds`/`#edit` are total field and editable-field counts.

| Object type | `TYPE()` | `keys()` (primary) | key secondary / identifiers | #flds | #edit | grid.py line | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bus** | `Bus` | `BusNum` | `BusName`, `BusNomVolt`, `AreaNum`, `ZoneNum`, `BusName_NomVolt` | 588 | 111 | `6036` | **UNVERIFIED:** (no prose definition found; key field is `BusNum` since a bus is uniquely identified by its number). |
| **Gen** | `Gen` | `BusNum`, `GenID` | `GenStatus`, `GenMWSetPoint`, `GenMVRMax/Min`, `GenMWMax/Min`, `GenVoltSet` | 607 | 222 | `61768` | **UNVERIFIED:** (BidCurve subdata = piecewise-linear cost curve; ReactiveCapability subdata = MW vs. Min/Max MVAR limits). |
| **Load** | `Load` | `BusNum`, `LoadID` | `LoadStatus`, `LoadSMW`, `LoadSMVR` | 287 | 118 | `97444` | **UNVERIFIED:** (BidCurve subdata = piecewise-linear benefit curve; costs must be increasing for loads). |
| **Branch** (line) | `Branch` | `BusNum`, `BusNum:1`, `LineCircuit` *(+`BusName_NomVolt:1`)* | `LineR`, `LineX`, `LineAMVA` (rating), `BusName_NomVolt` | 811 | 188 | `4298` | A network element (e.g. transmission line) connecting a from-bus and to-bus with a circuit ID; MW flow direction runs from-bus → to-bus. |
| **Transformer** | `Transformer` | `BusNum`, `BusNum:1`, `LineCircuit` *(+`BusName_NomVolt:1`)* | `LineXFType`, `XFTapMax/Min`, `XFStep`, `XFAuto`, `XFRegMax/Min` | 814 | 193 | `176297` | The `3WXFormer` type — a three-winding transformer modeled internally as a container of two-winding transformer branches joined at a common star bus. |
| **Shunt** (switched) | `Shunt` | `BusNum`, `ShuntID` | `SSStatus`, `SSNMVR`, `SSCMode` | 302 | 154 | `156986` | A switched shunt device (e.g. capacitor bank or reactor) at a bus that injects/absorbs Mvar in discrete steps. |
| **DCTransmissionLine** | `DCTransmissionLine` | `BusNum`, `BusNum:1`, `DCLID` *(+`BusName_NomVolt:1`)* | `DCLMode`, `DCLSetVolt`, `DCLR`, `DCLAlpha`, `DCLGamma` | 324 | 184 | `21018` | **UNVERIFIED:** (no prose found for the plain 2-terminal type; grouped with VSCDCLine/MSLine/3WXFormer/MTDC* as Edit-Mode-only topology objects). |
| **MultiSectionLine** | `MultiSectionLine` | `BusNum`, `BusNum:1`, `LineCircuit` *(+`BusName_NomVolt:1`)* | `BusInt`, `BusInt:1…` (section buses) | 149 | 48 | `127339` | A transmission line (MSLine) modeled as segments joined by intermediate dummy buses, running in order from the From Bus to the To Bus. |
| **Area** | `Area` | `AreaNum` | `AreaName` | 446 | 95 | `1693` | **UNVERIFIED:** (no prose definition found beyond an unrelated SelectByCriteriaSet reference). |
| **Zone** | `Zone` | `ZoneNum` | `ZoneName` | 390 | 57 | `192861` | **UNVERIFIED:** (no prose definition found beyond an unrelated SelectByCriteriaSet reference). |
| **Substation** | `Substation` | `SubNum` | `SubName` | 512 | 90 | `168780` | Groups the equipment/buses at a physical site to support full node-breaker topology modeling (vs. simpler bus-branch representation). |
| **SuperArea** | `SuperArea` | `SAName` | *(none flagged secondary)* | 198 | 32 | `169809` | A named grouping of Areas, each assigned an optional participation factor. |
| **Owner** | `Owner` | `OwnerNum` | `OwnerName` | 126 | 37 | `130894` | An entity holding ownership of buses, loads, generators, and branches; generator ownership is recorded as a percentage fraction. |
| **InjectionGroup** | `InjectionGroup` | `InjGrpName` | *(none flagged secondary)* | 174 | 65 | `87889` | A named collection of participation points (gens, loads, switched shunts, buses, or other injection groups), each with a participation factor, for an aggregate/distributed injection. |
| **Interface** | `Interface` | `FGName` | `IntNum`, `IntMonDir` | 149 | 43 | `88373` | A monitored aggregate power-flow quantity, summing (directional) flow/injection across branches, DC lines, MSLines, gens, loads, injection groups, areas, zones, or other interfaces. |
| **Nomogram** | `Nomogram` | `FGName` | *(none flagged secondary)* | 45 | 25 | `127898` | A safe-operating limit curve relating simultaneous flows on two interfaces, bounded by vertex breakpoints (NomogramBreakPoint). |
| **Contingency** | `Contingency` | `CTGLabel` | *(none flagged secondary)* | 166 | 40 | `10980` | **UNVERIFIED:** (no standalone prose found; only its CTGElement subdata format — an ordered list of actions with optional criteria/status/timing — is documented). |

Notes / gotchas read from source:
- **Branch / Transformer / DCLine / MSLine** are all two-terminal: the `:1` suffix is
  the **to-bus** (`BusNum` = from, `BusNum:1` = to), plus a circuit id
  (`LineCircuit`, or `DCLID` for DC). The generator also flags `BusName_NomVolt:1` as
  `PRIMARY` — it is a composite "BusName_NomVolt" identifier for the to-bus; the
  numeric `BusNum`/`BusNum:1`/`LineCircuit` triple is the one you normally supply.
- **Transformer is a separate `GObject` class** from `Branch` (`grid.py:176297`), but
  in PowerWorld a transformer is still a Branch with `LineXFType` set — the two schemas
  overlap heavily (both expose `LineR`/`LineX`, ratings, `Branch*` fields).
- **`ThreeWXFormer`** (`grid.py:9`) is the 3-winding transformer with a different key
  shape (`BusIdentifier`, `BusIdentifier:1`, `BusIdentifier:2`, `LineCircuit`) — use it
  for 3-winders, not `Transformer`.
- **Substation**: `grid.py` declares `SubNum`/`SubName` **twice** in the class body
  (duplicate enum members). Under Python ≥3.13's stricter `Enum` this raises on import
  (the package targets 3.11, where the dup is treated as an alias). Effective key is
  `SubNum`, secondary `SubName`.
- **` contingencies / interfaces / injection groups / nomograms`** are **string-keyed**
  (`CTGLabel`, `FGName`, `InjGrpName`) — no numeric key.
- Keyless objects exist too (e.g. `Sim_Solution_Options`): `Type.keys()` is empty and
  the bracket setter takes a positional value list instead (`indexable.py:282-296`).

## Part B — SAW SimAuto command catalog

`SAW` (`saw/saw.py:28-55`) is assembled by the **mixin pattern**: `SAWBase` plus 19
mixins. Reach it via `pw.esa`. Two call styles inside:
`_com_call(...)` wraps a direct SimAuto COM function; `_run_script("Cmd", *args)`
(`base.py:202`) builds a PowerWorld **script command** string and routes it through
`RunScriptCommand`. So a mixin method named `EnterMode` *is* the script command
`EnterMode(...)` — the Python method name = the PowerWorld aux/script command name.

### B.1 Mixins (what each covers) — `saw/`

| Mixin | File | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `SAWBase` | `base.py` | COM core: connect/`exit`, `RunScriptCommand`/`RunScriptCommand2`, `ProcessAuxFile`, `exec_aux`, `_run_script`/`_com_call` plumbing, properties (`CreateIfNotFound`, `ProcessID`) |
| `DataMixin` | `data.py` | **The data layer** — Get/Change Parameters (single/multiple/rect/typed), `GetFieldList`, `ListOfDevices` |
| `PowerflowMixin` | `powerflow.py` | `SolvePowerFlow`, flat start, mismatch/tolerance, **`SaveState`/`LoadState`**, diff-case |
| `GeneralMixin` | `general.py` | `EnterMode`, `StoreState`/`RestoreState`/`DeleteState`, aux/CSV load (`LoadAux`, `LoadCSV`, `ImportData`), `SaveData`, `SetData`/`CreateData`, `GetSubData`/`SetSubData`, `Delete`, `SelectAll` |
| `CaseActionsMixin` | `case_actions.py` | `OpenCase`/`OpenCaseType`, `SaveCase`, `CloseCase`, `NewCase`, renumbering, `Scale` |
| `ModifyMixin` | `modify.py` | Topology/model edits: `Move`, `SplitBus`/`MergeBuses`, `TapTransmissionLine`, injection-group/interface create, participation factors |
| `ContingencyMixin` | `contingency.py` | `CTGSolve`/`CTGSolveAll`, `CTGAutoInsert`, `CTGApply`, OTDF, read/write CTG files |
| `TransientMixin` | `transient.py` | Transient stability: `TSSolve`/`TSSolveAll`, `TSInitialize`, `TSGetResults`, result storage, model load/save |
| `SensitivityMixin` | `sensitivity.py` | `CalculatePTDF`, `CalculateLODF`(+matrix/screening), `CalculateShiftFactors`, loss/volt sense |
| `MatrixMixin` | `matrices.py` | `get_ybus`, `get_jacobian`(+ids), `get_gmatrix`, `SaveJacobian` |
| `TopologyMixin` | `topology.py` | Path/island analysis, `CloseWithBreakers`/`OpenWithBreakers`, `ExpandBusTopology`, `SaveConsolidatedCase` |
| `RegionsMixin` | `regions.py` | Area/zone/region operations |
| `ScheduledActionsMixin` | `scheduled.py` | Scheduled-action automation |
| `TimeStepMixin` | `timestep.py` | **TimeStep weather feature** — `TimeStepDoRun`, `TimeStepLoadPWW*`, B3D/TSB load-save, `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet` |
| `WeatherMixin` | `weather.py` | Weather data helpers |
| `GICMixin` | `gic.py` | Geomagnetically-induced-current commands |
| `OPFMixin` / `PVMixin` / `QVMixin` / `ATCMixin` / `FaultMixin` | `opf.py` … `fault.py` | OPF, PV/QV curves, ATC, fault analysis |

### B.2 Most-used methods (the ones agents actually call)

**Reading data** (`saw/data.py`):
- `GetParametersMultipleElement(ObjectType, ParamList, FilterName="")` → `DataFrame`
  (string output, `data.py:284`). The classic ESA read.
- `GetParamsRectTyped(ObjectType, ParamList, FilterName="")` → typed `DataFrame`
  (preserves native variant types; `data.py:324`). **This is what the bracket read
  uses.**
- `GetParametersSingleElement(ObjectType, ParamList, Values)` → `Series` (`data.py:246`).
- `GetFieldList(ObjectType)` → all available fields for a type (`data.py:187`);
  `ListOfDevices(ObjType, FilterName="")` → device keys (`data.py:478`).

**Writing data** (`saw/data.py`):
- `ChangeParametersMultipleElementRect(ObjectType, ParamList, df)` — push a whole
  DataFrame back (`data.py:88`). **Used by the bracket setter.** `ParamList` **must
  lead with the key fields.**
- `ChangeParametersMultipleElement(ObjectType, ParamList, ValueList)` (`data.py:54`).
- `ChangeParametersSingleElement(ObjectType, ParamList, Values)` (`data.py:21`).

**Mode / state / solve**:
- `EnterMode("EDIT" | "RUN")` (`general.py:200`) — must be in EDIT to create/delete
  objects; RUN to solve. Accepts `PowerWorldMode.EDIT/RUN`.
- `SolvePowerFlow(SolMethod=SolverMethod.RECTNEWT)` (`powerflow.py:10`) — also accepts
  `"POLARNEWT"`, `"GAUSS"`, `"DC"`, etc.
- `SaveState()` / `LoadState()` (`powerflow.py:382`/`390`) — the **single** PowerWorld
  power-flow state stack (`pw.snapshot()` context manager wraps these).
- `StoreState(name)` / `RestoreState(name, state_type="USER")` / `DeleteState(name)`
  (`general.py:225`/`246`/`267`) — **named** states (different from Save/LoadState).

**Case actions** (`saw/case_actions.py`): `OpenCase(FileName)` (`33`),
`SaveCase(FileName=None, FileType="PWB", Overwrite=True)` (`127`), `CloseCase()` (`113`),
`NewCase()` (`254`), `Scale(...)` (`458`).

**Aux / script** (`saw/base.py` + `general.py`):
- `RunScriptCommand(Statements)` (`base.py:240`) — run a raw PowerWorld script string.
- `RunScriptCommand2(Statements, StatusMessage)` (`base.py:260`).
- `ProcessAuxFile(FileName)` (`base.py:179`) / `exec_aux(aux, ...)` (`base.py:422`) —
  run an aux file / inline aux text.
- `LoadAux(filename, create_if_not_found=False)` (`general.py:288`),
  `LoadCSV` (`337`), `ImportData` (`311`).

**TimeStep (weather)** (`saw/timestep.py`): `TimeStepDoRun(start, end)` (`10`),
`TimeStepDoSinglePoint(time_point)` (`28`), `TimeStepLoadPWW(filename, solution_type)`
(`146`), `TimeStepLoadPWWRange(...)` (`164`), `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet(object_type,
field_list, filter_name)` (`268`), `TimeStepLoadB3D` (`135`), `TimeStepLoadTSB`/`SaveTSB`
(`307`/`318`). *(This is PowerWorld's TimeStep feature — NOT transient stability; see the
TS disambiguation on [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md).)*

**Contingency** (`saw/contingency.py`): `CTGSolve(ctg_name)` (`11`),
`CTGSolveAll(distributed=False, clear_results=True)` (`33`), `CTGAutoInsert()` (`61`),
`CTGApply(name)` (`136`), `CTGWriteResultsAndOptions(...)` (`79`).

**Transient stability** (`saw/transient.py`): `TSSolve(...)` (`58`), `TSSolveAll()`
(`96`), `TSInitialize()` (`28`), `TSGetResults(...)` (`326`),
`TSResultStorageSetAll(object="ALL", value=True)` (`41`).

**Matrices / sensitivities**: `get_ybus(full=False)` (`matrices.py:15`),
`get_jacobian(full=False, form=JacobianForm.RECTANGULAR)` (`matrices.py:178`),
`CalculatePTDF(seller, buyer, method=LinearMethod.DC)` (`sensitivity.py:36`),
`CalculateLODF(branch, method=LinearMethod.DC)` (`sensitivity.py:65`),
`CalculateShiftFactors(...)` (`sensitivity.py:197`).

### B.3 Common `RunScriptCommand(...)` script commands

Task-organized SCRIPT-command index (198 actions) → aux script catalog.
The named methods above (§B.2) remain the preferred Python entry points; the catalog
is the raw script-command reference for anything unwrapped.

> Preference (per wiki house rules): for **data**, use the bracket interface
> (`pw[Gen, fields]`, `pw[Gen] = df`) over raw `GetParametersMultipleElement` /
> `ChangeParametersMultipleElementRect`; for **script commands**, use the named SAW
> methods (`pw.esa.SolvePowerFlow()`) or `pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("...")` for anything
> not yet wrapped. See [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md) for end-to-end recipes and [powerworld-simauto](../concepts/powerworld-simauto.md)
> for the underlying COM server.

# Reference: every PowerWorld option object and its fields (Simulator 25)

## Abstract

All 32 PowerWorld `*_Options` objects and their 1,079 fields, generated from the Simulator 25
field export. Use it to find the exact field behind any study setting. For which fields matter per
study, whether each is verified, and the traps, read [powerworld-study-options](powerworld-study-options.md) first.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Hub:** [powerworld-study-options](powerworld-study-options.md) (curated: which option to change for which study, provenance-tagged)
- **Across:** [powerworld-study-commands](powerworld-study-commands.md) (the SCRIPT commands that run each study) · [esapp-schema-reference](esapp-schema-reference.md) (key fields for non-option objects)

## Content

Generated 2026-09-28 from `powerworld-object-fields-v25.xlsx` (in this folder), the PowerWorld
Simulator 25 (beta) field export dated 2026-09-12. **Nothing here is hand-written: the descriptions
are PowerWorld's.** Regenerate on a new Simulator build rather than editing rows.

- Per-object boilerplate fields (custom expressions, calculated fields, data checks, `ObjectID`,
  `Selected`) are omitted.
- **enterable**: `Yes` = writable by `SetData`; `AUX/Paste` = writable only from an aux file or a
  paste; `read-only` = cannot be written.
- A `:N` suffix is a distinct field (`MaxItr:1` is not `MaxItr`). **concise** is a second name for
  the same field; the aux parser accepts either.
- Set a field with `SetData(<object>, [field], [value]);` (esapp: `pw.esa.SetData(...)`), then
  **read it back**: a write that changes nothing still reports success.
- Grouped by study area. Transient and GIC come last and are outside steady-state work.

### Power flow and solution

#### `Sim_Solution_Options` (82 fields)

| field | concise | type | enterable | dialog path | description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SEOCloseCBToEnergizeSShunts` | CloseCBToEnergizeShunts | String | Yes | Close Breakers to Energize Switched Shunts | Set to YES to allow switched shunts that are presently not energized to participate in automatic switched shunt control if they can be energized by closing breakers (or load break disconnects). |
| `DCIgnoreXFImpedanceCorrection` | DCXFCorrIgnore | String | Yes | DC Approximation\Ignore Transformer Impedance Correction | Set to YES to ignore the transformer impedance correction in the DC approximation. Normally this should be ignored. |

| `ContingentInterfaceEnforcement` | CTGInterfaceEnforcement | Integer | Yes | General\Contingent Interface Inclusion | Contingent Interface Inclusion (Never = never enforce flows; PowerFlow = only enforce in power flow and OPF; 2 : CTG = also enforce in Contingency and SCOPF) |
| `DisableAngleRotation` |  | String | Yes | General\Disable Angle Rotation | Set to YES to disable voltage angle rotation. Normally at the end of a power flow solution angles are brought inside of +/- 160 degrees if possible. |
| `SEODisableAngleSmoothing` | DisableAngleSmoothing | String | Yes | General\Disable Angle Smoothing | Set to YES to disable the angle smoothing that is done as a preprocess to the power flow. Angle smoothing attempts to reduce large angle differences across branches that have been been closed in. Normally this option should NOT be disabled. |
| `RestoreSolution` | DisableRestoreSolution | String | Yes | General\Disable Restore last successful solution | Disable Restore last successful solution |
| `RestoreState` | DisableRestoreState | String | Yes | General\Disable Restore State before failed solution attempt | Disable Restore State before failed solution attempt |
| `SEODisableXFTapControlIfSensWrongSign` | DisableXFTapWrongSign | String | Yes | General\Disable Transformer Tap Control if Sens. Wrong Sign | Set this to YES to disable transformer control when a transformer is regulating one of its own terminal buses and the tap sensitivity is the wrong sign. If regulating the from bus the correct sign is positive and when regulating the to bus the correct sign is negative. This should normally be set to YES. |
| `AllowMultIslands` | DynAssignSlack | String | Yes | General\Dynamically assign slack buses (Allow Multiple Islands) | Set to YES to allow Simulator to determine automatically add or remove a slack buses as system topology changes. Preference is given to the buses chosen by the user to be slack buses while in Edit Mode. Otherwise the generation with the largest maximum MW is given preference. |
| `EvalSolutionIsland` |  | String | Yes | General\Evaluate Solution for Each Island | Set to YES so that the power flow solution only terminates if all viable islands in the case fail to converge. As long as one island continues to converge the solution will continue. Also after completing a power flow solution, if some islands solve while others do not, then the Solved field of each island will be populated to indicate which ones sucessfully converged. |
| `EvalSolutionIsland:1` | EvalSolutionIslandRequireLargest | String | Yes | General\Evaluate Solution Require Largest Island Solved | When EvalSolutionIsland = YES, a solution only terminates if all viable islands in the case fail to converge. Set this option to YES to require that the island with the largest number of buses in it must also converge. If the largest island does not converge then entire solution is reported as unsolved. |
| `LossSenseFunc` |  | String | Yes | General\Loss Sensitivity Function | Loss Sensitivity Function |
| `SBase` | MVABase | String | Yes | General\SBase |  |
| `UsePSLFConverterApproximatePowerFactor` | UsePSLFConvApproxPowerFactor | String | Yes | General\Use Approximate DC Converter Power Factor Equations | Recommended value is NO. Set to YES to use an approximate calculation (to match what PSLF does) for DC converter power factor of cos(Phi) = 1/2*(cos(alpha) + cos(alpha+mu)) instead of the more accurate equations normally used. |
| `UsePSLFConverterIncorrectFixedTap` | UsePSLFConvIncorrectFixedTap | String | Yes | General\Use PSLF treatment of Fixed Tap in DC Converters | NO is recommended value. This only impacts DC converter transformer equations. NO - Uses the correct equation of TotalTap = VariableTap + FixedTap - 1; YES - Uses the incorrect equation of TotalTap = VariableTap*FixedTap (implemented by PSLF). |
| `ConvergenceTol:2` | MVAConvergenceTol | Real | Yes | Inner Power Flow Loop\Convergence Tolerance in MVA | Convergence Tolerance in MVA |
| `ConvergenceTol` | PUConvergenceTol | Real | Yes | Inner Power Flow Loop\Convergence Tolerance in PU | Convergence Tolerance. Note: In the AUX file, this value is written in per unit. Thus if SBase=100, then a 0.1 MVA tolerance should be written as 0.001 |
| `DisableOptMult` |  | String | Yes | Inner Power Flow Loop\Disable Optimal Multiplier | Set to YES to disable the optimal multiplier in the inner power flow loop iterations. Normally this should NOT be done. |
| `DoOneIteration` |  | String | Yes | Inner Power Flow Loop\Do One Iteration | Do only one inner power flow loop iteration |
| `FlatStart` | FlatStartInit | String | Yes | Inner Power Flow Loop\Flat Start | Initialize the system to a flat start at the beginning of each power flow solution. When this option is YES it gets applied when using the Solve Power Flow option from the GUI, using the Auto Solve On Load option, and when Animating in the GUI. This option is not used when solving the power flow using script commands. |

| `MinVoltSLoad` |  | Real | Yes | Inner Power Flow Loop\Minimum PU Voltage for Constant Power Loads | Minimum Per Unit Voltage for Constant Power Loads. If the voltage at the terminal bus falls below this value the load will decrease using a cosine function towards a value of zero load at zero voltage. |
| `VarLimitBackoffVtol` |  | Real | Yes | Inner Power Flow Loop\Var Limit Backoff Voltage Tolerance | Tolerance on when to backoff generator Mvar limits based on how far the regulated the bus voltage is beyond the voltage setpoint. This controls the transition from a PQ to a PV bus. |

# Reference: SCRIPT commands that run and control each study, with every parameter

## Abstract

Every aux SCRIPT command that runs or configures a PowerWorld study, grouped by study area, with
each parameter's meaning and default, how options are written in aux, and 29 silent behaviours.
Read "Surprises" before automating a study. Option-object fields live on [powerworld-option-objects-v25](powerworld-option-objects-v25.md).

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Hub:** [powerworld-study-options](powerworld-study-options.md) (which option to change per study, provenance-tagged)
- **Across:** [powerworld-option-objects-v25](powerworld-option-objects-v25.md) (the option fields these commands read) · [aux-script-commands](aux-script-commands.md) (the task-organised command index) · [parallel-contingency-solve](../concepts/parallel-contingency-solve.md) (parallel contingencies without PowerWorld's distributed add-on)

## Content

Source: PowerWorld, *Auxiliary File Format for Simulator 24*, last updated 2026-09-01 (PowerWorld publishes it with Simulator; page numbers refer to that PDF).
Extracted 2026-09-28. Every syntax line, parameter and default is cited to its PDF page, and five of the
highest-stakes claims (SetData's filter rule, ResetToFlatStart's setpoint reset, LODF's missing AC
method, CTGSolveAll clearing skipped results, the three-level solution-option precedence) were
re-read against the text. **Version skew:** this document is for Simulator 24 while the field
export is Simulator 25 — command syntax comes from here, field names from the export.

Where the document is silent or contradicts itself the tables say so. Nothing here is inferred.

General statement grammar (p.16): `Keyword(arg1, arg2, ...);` Lists go in `[ ]`. Statements end with `;`,
may span lines, and several can share a line. Omitted optional arguments are left blank between commas,
e.g. `CalculateLODF([BRANCH 1 2 1], DC, );` (p.79). YES/NO flags are bare words. Strings go in **straight**
double quotes; smart quotes fail (p.15).

Object identifier formats used by many commands (e.g. p.79, p.84, pp.47-48):
`[BUS num]`, `[BUS "name_nomkv"]`, `[BUS "label"]`; `[BRANCH bus1 bus2 ckt]`, `[BRANCH "name_kv1" "name_kv2" ckt]`,
`[BRANCH "buslabel1" "buslabel2" ckt]`, `[BRANCH "label"]`; `[GEN bus id]`; `[AREA num|"name"|"label"]`,
`[ZONE ...]`, `[SUPERAREA "name"|"label"]`, `[INJECTIONGROUP "name"|"label"]`, `[INTERFACE "name"|"label"]`, `[SLACK]`.

---

### Filter syntax (applies to every command with a `filter` parameter)

| form | meaning | page |
|---|---|---|
| blank | "Unless otherwise specified, a blank filter will select all objects." Exceptions are listed per command below (SetData, EstimateVoltages, InterfaceCreate, SetSelectedFromNetworkCut). | p.16 |
| `"FilterName"` | Name of an advanced filter of the same object type, in double quotes. | p.16 |
| `"<Objecttype>filtername"` | Advanced filter belonging to a **different** object type, e.g. a bus filter applied to generators. | p.16 |
| `"<DEVICE>objecttype 'key1' 'key2' 'key3'"` | Device filter: select by relation to one specific object, e.g. `"<DEVICE>Bus 1"` (p.45), `"<Device>Area 2"` (p.43). | p.16 |
| `AREAZONE` | Only objects meeting the area/zone/owner filters. | p.16 |
| `SELECTED` | Only objects whose Selected field is YES. | p.16 |
| `ALL` | Accepted by many commands explicitly (SetData, ConditionVoltagePockets, InterfaceFlattenFilter, etc.). For SetData it is **required** to mean "all". | p.31, p.54 |
| `"Variablename Comparison Value1 Value2"` | Inline single-condition filter, no filter object needed (added Oct 5 2023 patch of v23). Examples: `"NomkV between 220 550"`, `"MW >= 50"`, `"AreaNumber = 1"`, `"Name contains 'Combined'"`, `"SubNumber IsBlank"`. | p.16, p.44, p.44, p.76 |
| Branch-traverse filters | `DeterminePathDistance`, `DetermineShortestPath`, `SetBusFieldFromClosest` take `All`, `Selected`, `Closed`, or a branch advanced-filter name. | p.74, p.76 |
| LODF-specific keywords | `CalculateLODFScreening` adds `CTG` (branches in any defined contingency) and `LIMITMONITOR` (branches meeting Limit Monitoring Settings); `SAME` in monitor filters means "same set as filterProcess". | p.81, p.81, p.80 |

Defining an advanced filter as DATA (p.189; condition operators p.188):
```
FILTER (objecttype, filtername, filtertype, prefilter)
{
BUS "a bus filter" "AND" "no"
   <SUBDATA CONDITION>
      BusNomVolt  >  100
      AreaNum   inrange  "1 - 5 , 7 , 90-95"
   </SUBDATA>
}
```
Condition operators: `between (><)`, `notbetween (~><)`, `equal (= ==)`, `notequal (<> ~=)`, `greaterthan (>)`, `lessthan (<)`,
`greaterthanorequal (>=)`, `lessthanorequal (<=)`, `about`, `notabout` (take a tolerance), `contains`, `notcontains`, `startswith`,
`notstartswith`, `inrange`, `notinrange`, `meets`, `notmeets`, `isblank`, `notisblank` (p.188). A condition line can be
`_UseAnotherFilter meets|notmeets <filtername>` (p.188). An optional trailing `ABS` (or legacy `1`) makes strings case-sensitive
and takes absolute values (p.188). The meaning of the `filtertype` and `prefilter` header fields is shown only by example
(`"AND"`/`"OR"`, `"no"`); the document does not define them.

Per-command filter exceptions:
- `SetData` with the filter omitted does **not** mean all objects. The key fields must then be in the field list and it updates one object (p.31, p.31).
- `EstimateVoltages` fails on a blank filter (p.58).
- `InterfaceCreate` requires a non-blank filter (p.45).
- `SetSelectedFromNetworkCut`: a blank Branch/Interface/DCLine filter selects **nothing**, and at least one of the three must be non-blank (p.77).
- `InjectionGroupRemoveDuplicates` and `InterfaceRemoveDuplicates` reject `SELECTED` and `AREAZONE` (p.44, p.46).
- `CTGProcessRemedialActionsAndDependencies` does not accept `AREAZONE` (p.95).
- `QVWriteCurves` ignores `AREAZONE` on QVCurve objects and returns all results (p.126).
- `CTGCreateContingentInterfaces` and `ATCCreateContingentInterfaces` take only an advanced-filter **name** (p.93, p.103).

### Special keywords and value tricks inside parameters

| item | syntax | page |
|---|---|---|
| File/text keywords | `@BUILDDATE @CASEFILENAME @CASEFILEPATH @CASENAME @DATE @DATETIME @TIME @VERSION`, plus `@MODELFIELD<objecttype 'key1' 'key2' variablename:digits:rod>` | p.17 |
| Prompt the user for a file | `"<PROMPT 'Caption' 'FileTypes' 'InitialDirectory' 'CancelAction'>"`. CancelAction is `Abort` (default) or `Continue`. Does **not** work under SimAuto. | p.17 |
| `ALL` in field lists | `SaveData`, `SaveDataWithExtra`, `SaveObjectFields`, `SendToExcel`: `ALL` in place of the field list returns all fields, and `Var:ALL` returns every location, e.g. `LinePTDFMult:ALL`, `MultBusTLRSens:ALL`. | p.18 |
| TS model params | `AllModelParams`, `AllModelParamsPriKey`, `AllModelParamsSecKey`, `AllModelParamsLabel` in Save* field lists | p.18 |
| Field-valued inputs | `"@var:loc:digits:dec"` or `"@concisename:loc:digits:dec"` reads a field of the same object | p.75 |
| Other object's field | `"&Objecttype 'keys' concisename:digits:dec"`, `"&ModelExpressionName:digits:dec"`, `"&Objecttype '@keyfield' field"`, `"&@field field2"`. Usable for key-field values in SetData/CreateData. Default is 7 decimals. | pp.160-161 |
| Field precision | `variablenamelegacy:location:digits:rod` or `concisename:digits:rod` in Save field lists | p.25 |
| Sort list | `[var1:+:0, var2:-:1]`: +/- ascending/descending (required); 0/1 = case-insensitive-no-abs / case-sensitive-or-abs (optional) | pp.25-26 |

#### Power flow solution and initialization

| command | syntax | parameters (meaning, allowed values, default) | page |
|---|---|---|---|
| SolvePowerFlow | `SolvePowerFlow(SolMethod, "filename1", "filename2", CreateIfNotFound1, CreateIfNotFound2);` | **SolMethod**: `RECTNEWT` (rectangular NR), `POLARNEWTON`, `GAUSSSEIDEL`, `FASTDEC`, `ROBUST` (robust solution process), `DC`. Default is RECTNEWT if the case is in AC mode and DC if it is in DC mode. **DC switches the case into DC mode, and any AC method switches it back to AC.** The doc warns an AC solve can be hard after the case has been in DC. **filename1**: aux loaded on success, or `STOP` to halt all aux execution; default "". **filename2**: aux loaded on failure, or `STOP`; default "". **CreateIfNotFound1/2**: default NO with a legacy header, YES with a concise header, and only enforced when the legacy header says PROMPT (otherwise YES). | pp.60-61 |
| ResetToFlatStart | `ResetToFlatStart(FlatVoltagesAngles, ShuntsToMax, LTCsToMiddle, PSAnglesToMiddle);` | **FlatVoltagesAngles** YES/NO, default YES: sets all \|V\| **and generator setpoint voltages** to 1.0 pu and angles to 0. **ShuntsToMax** default NO: moves switched shunts half-way to max Mvar. **LTCsToMiddle** default NO. **PSAnglesToMiddle** default NO. | p.59 |
| ClearPowerFlowSolutionAidValues | `ClearPowerFlowSolutionAidValues;` | None. Clears the internal branch-status and generator-MW-estimate memory that drives angle smoothing and generator MW estimation before a solve, so Simulator does not alter initial V/angle or generator MW. | p.54 |
| ConditionVoltagePockets | `ConditionVoltagePockets(VoltageThreshold, AngleThreshold, filter);` | **VoltageThreshold**: pu \|ΔV\| across a branch. **AngleThreshold**: degrees \|Δθ\|. **filter** (branches): optional, omitted means all; accepts ALL/SELECTED/AREAZONE/"name". Re-estimates voltages inside pockets bounded by such branches. | p.54 |
| EstimateVoltages | `EstimateVoltages(filter);` | **filter** (buses): required, and blank is an error. Estimates V/angle at buses meeting the filter from the surrounding buses that do not. | p.58 |
| VoltageConditioning | `VoltageConditioning;` | None. Uses Voltage Conditioning tool options and case voltage targets. | p.63 |
| UpdateIslandsAndBusStatus | `UpdateIslandsAndBusStatus;` | None. Refreshes islands and bus energization without solving. This is done automatically at the start of each solve. | p.61 |
| ZeroOutMismatches | `ZeroOutMismatches(ObjectType);` | **ObjectType**: `BUSSHUNT` (default) adjusts bus shunt fields, `LOAD` adds loads with ID `Q1` (incremented if taken). Applies at buses whose mismatch exceeds the MVA tolerance. | p.61 |
| InitializeGenMvarLimits | `InitializeGenMvarLimits;` | None. Re-marks generators as at/not-at Mvar limits. | p.43 |
| GenForceLDC_RCC | `GenForceLDC_RCC(filter);` | **filter** (gens): default all. Sets the gen setpoint to the present LDC/RCC-point voltage. If \|Z\| ≤ 2e-6·MVAbase the gen regulates its terminal bus instead. | p.59 |
| InterfacesCalculatePostCTGMWFlows | `InterfacesCalculatePostCTGMWFlows;` | None. Updates contingent-interface flows per the *Monitor/Enforce Contingent Interface Elements* option. Does nothing if that option is "Never". | p.59 |
| DoCTGAction | `DoCTGAction([action]);` or `DoCTGAction("action");` | One CTGElement-format action string (see "Contingency action strings" below). COMPENSATION sections are not allowed. Example `DoCTGAction([BRANCH One_138.0 Two_138.0 1 OPEN]);` | p.58 |
| RotateBusAnglesInIsland | `RotateBusAnglesInIsland([BUS key], Value);` | Shifts all angles in the bus's island so that the bus sits at **Value** degrees. | p.49 |
| SetScheduledVoltageForABus | `SetScheduledVoltageForABus([bus identifier], voltage);` | Sets the EPC vsched. **Also sets the setpoints of gens and switched shunts regulating the bus**, and re-centres the shunt band as vband=(VHigh-VLow)/2. The BUS prefix and brackets are optional. | pp.50-51 |
| SaveJacobian | `SaveJacobian("JacFile", "JIDFile", FileType, JacForm);` | **FileType**: `M` (Matlab), `TXT`, `EXPM` (Matlab, exponential). **JacForm**: `R` (AC rectangular), `P` (AC polar), `DC` (B'). | p.60 |
| SaveYbusInMatlabFormat | `SaveYbusInMatlabFormat("filename", IncludeVoltages);` | **IncludeVoltages** YES/NO | p.60 |
| SaveGenLimitStatusAction | `SaveGenLimitStatusAction("filename");` | Text dump of gen Mvar, limits and AVR flags | p.59 |
| StoreState | `StoreState(StateName);` | **StateName** optional. Blank stores the one unnamed state, and a unique name stores one of several. | p.63 |
| RestoreState | `RestoreState(WhichState, StateName);` | **WhichState**: `USER` (default; from StoreState), `BEFOREFAILED` (auto-stored before each solve and **removed once any later solve succeeds**), `LASTSUCCESSFUL` (auto-stored after each successful solve). **StateName** is used only with USER; blank means the unnamed state. **Fails if the state was not set.** | pp.62-63 |
| DeleteState | `DeleteState(WhichState, StateName);` | Same options as RestoreState. Fails if the state was not set. | p.62 |

Note: `SaveState`/`LoadState` **do not exist** in this document. The state commands are `StoreState`/`RestoreState`/`DeleteState` (TOC p.4).

#### OPF and SCOPF

| command | syntax | parameters | page |
|---|---|---|---|
| SolvePrimalLP | `SolvePrimalLP("filename1", "filename2", CreateIfNotFound1, CreateIfNotFound2);` | filename1: aux on success or `STOP`. filename2: aux on failure or `STOP`. Both default "". CreateIfNotFound works as in SolvePowerFlow. Iterates PF ↔ LP until converged. | p.118 |
| InitializePrimalLP | `InitializePrimalLP("filename1", "filename2", CreateIfNotFound1, CreateIfNotFound2);` | Clears all previous primal-LP structures and results. Same parameters. | pp.118-119 |
| SolveSinglePrimalLPOuterLoop | `SolveSinglePrimalLPOuterLoop("filename1", "filename2", CreateIfNotFound1, CreateIfNotFound2);` | Same parameters. Runs one LP, then one PF, then stops. | p.119 |
| SolveFullSCOPF | `SolveFullSCOPF(BCMethod, "filename1", "filename2", CreateIfNotFound1, CreateIfNotFound2);` | **BCMethod**: `POWERFLOW` (default) or `OPF` for the base case. The rest as above. | pp.119-120 |
| OPFWriteResultsAndOptions | `OPFWriteResultsAndOptions("filename");` | Writes limit monitoring and area/bus/branch/interface/gen/superarea OPF options plus OPF solution options | p.120 |

All OPF tuning lives in option objects set with SetData/DATA. No command parameter exposes it.

### Aux option syntax

1. **Two DATA header forms.**
   - Concise (default since v19): `object_type DataName(field1, field2, ...) { values }`. No square brackets. Data is **always space-delimited**, and **Create_if_not_found is always YES** (p.157, p.158).
   - Legacy: `DATA DataName(object_type, [field1, field2], file_type_specifier, create_if_not_found) { ... }`. file_type_specifier is blank/AUXDEF/DEF (space) or AUXCSV/CSV/CSVAUX (comma). create_if_not_found is YES, NO, or PROMPT, and **YES if omitted** (pp.157-158, p.158).
   - Both forms are readable by v19+ (p.157). DataName is optional and is only used by `LoadData` (p.157).
2. **Setting an option object.** The document says to set options objects "using the SetData script command or DATA sections". Examples are `Equiv_Options` (p.34), `Ctg_AutoInsert_Options` (p.90), `SCALE_OPTIONS` (p.39), `TLR_Options` (p.84), `ATC_Options` (p.103), `IG_AutoInsert_Options` (p.43), and `CTGWriteAux_Options` (p.99). As DATA this is `Sim_Solution_Options (FieldA, FieldB) { valueA valueB }`, following the generic concise header.
3. **Key-less, single-record objects: not documented.** The document never explains how to address an object with no key fields. It says SetData without a filter needs key fields to find "the one object" (p.31, p.31), and it never says what happens when the object type has no keys. The document gives **no example** of `SetData(Sim_Solution_Options, ...)` or of a DATA block for an option object. Behaviour on an options object with the filter omitted is therefore unverified by this source. Test it before relying on it; `ALL` is the documented "all objects" filter.
4. **Per-contingency and per-tool solution options.** `Contingency`, `CTG_Options` and `QVCurve_Options` accept a `<SUBDATA Sim_Solution_Options>` block of **two lines**: field names first, then values (p.183, pp.183-184, p.206). The precedence is Contingency record > CTG_Options > global solution options (p.183).
5. **Field names.** The parser accepts concise and legacy names automatically (p.160). Concise names replace most location indices, e.g. legacy `LineMW:1` → `MWTo` (p.159). Location `:0` may be omitted (p.159). Dynamic-count fields keep `:n` (CustomFloat:n, PTDFMult:n) (p.159). Some fields can be referenced by user-defined name, e.g. `"CustomExpression:my name"`, `"CustomSingle:name"`, `"BGCalcField:name"` (p.159). Field lists are comma-separated and allow `//` comments (p.158). The field list for any object is available from Window > Export Case Object Fields, where key fields are starred (p.157, p.159).
6. **Creation vs edit (LoadAux is a merge).** A record whose key matches an existing object edits that object. A new object is created **only if all Required Fields are present** (and Create_if_not_found allows it). Otherwise the file silently only edits existing objects (p.158, p.158). Topology objects (Bus, Gen, Load, Shunt, Branch, LineShunt, DCTransmissionLine, VSCDCLine, MSLine, 3WXFormer, MTDC*) can be created **only in EDIT mode** (p.158).
7. **LoadAux CreateIfNotFound precedence.** The DATA section's own create flag overrides the LoadAux argument. The script argument is used only when the section says PROMPT (p.158, p.23).
8. **Deletion through DATA.** `REMOVEDBUS`, `REMOVEDBRANCH`, etc. delete objects when loaded in EDIT mode. Only the Difference-Flows object types have a REMOVED* form (p.157).
9. **SUBDATA.** The form is `<SUBDATA type> ... </SUBDATA>` inside a record, with a rigid per-type format (p.165). For Contingency, `CTGElement` **replaces** all existing elements and `CTGElementAppend` appends (p.170).
10. **Identification by label.** If the `Label` field is present it is the **only** identifier used, even when keys are also given. Blank labels are not read, and objects cannot be created by label (p.162). SUBDATA references resolve in this order: key fields, secondary keys, component labels, then labels (p.163).
11. **Values.** Strings with spaces or commas must be quoted (p.160). The `}` must be on its own line (p.160). Each record starts on its own line (p.160).
12. **Mode.** Mode-specific script commands switch RUN/EDIT themselves (p.16, p.34). `EnterMode(EDIT)` is needed explicitly for DATA creation of topology objects.

---

### Surprises / silent behaviour

1. **SetData with no filter is not "all".** It targets one object by keys, and `ALL` is needed for every object. Elsewhere, including `Delete`, a blank filter means all (p.31, p.16, p.22).
2. **`CTGSolveAll` clears results even for skipped contingencies** by default (`ClearAllResults` defaults to YES). The same holds for `CTGComboSolveAll` (pp.97-98, p.91).
3. **`CTGSolve` leaves the case in the post-contingency state.** Call `CTGRestoreReference` afterwards (p.97, p.96).
4. **`SolvePowerFlow(DC, ...)` flips the case into DC mode**, and later solves then default to DC. The doc warns AC may be hard to recover (p.60).
5. **`ResetToFlatStart` with defaults resets generator voltage setpoints to 1.0 pu**, not just bus voltages (p.59).
6. **Before each solve Simulator pre-processes** with angle smoothing and generator MW estimation from remembered state. `ClearPowerFlowSolutionAidValues` stops that (p.54).
7. **`RestoreState(BEFOREFAILED)` disappears after any successful solve**, and Restore/Delete **fail** if the state was never set (p.62, p.62).
8. **LoadAux's `CreateIfNotFound` is effectively ignored.** Concise headers always create. Legacy headers use their own flag, which defaults to YES, and the argument matters only for PROMPT. A record missing Required Fields never creates anything and gives no stated warning (p.23, p.157, p.158).
9. **Save commands append by default**: SaveData, SaveDataWithExtra, SaveDataEPC, CTGWriteAuxUsingOptions, the ATC/PV/QV Write*, and the DiffCase EPC writers. SaveDataUsingBuiltInAUXFormat and WriteTextToFile always append. The exceptions default to overwrite: CTGWriteFilePTI and ATCWriteScenarioLog (p.26, p.28, p.26, p.99, p.27, p.20, p.99, p.105).
10. **`CalculateShiftFactors` defaults to `AbortOnError=YES`**, so a failure kills the rest of the aux file (p.85).
11. **LODF has no AC method.** Only DC or DCPS is allowed. Islanding outages are reported as a huge number unless `IncludeIslandingCTG=NO` (p.79, p.81, p.80).
12. **Renamed commands** are still accepted under their old names: `CalculateTLR` → `CalculateShiftFactors`, `CalculateTLRMultipleElement` → `CalculateShiftFactorsMultipleElement`, `DiffFlow*` → `DiffCase*`, `ATCWriteAllOptions` → `ATCDataWriteOptionsAndResults` (p.84, p.86, p.54, p.104).
13. **`CTGAutoInsert`, `CTGPrimaryAutoInsert`, `FaultAutoInsert`, `InjectionGroupsAutoInsert` and `Equivalence` take no parameters.** Everything comes from their options objects, so stale options from a prior session silently drive the result (p.90, p.95, p.102, p.43, p.34).
14. **Contingencies run in creation order**, not name order. Use `CTGSort` first if order matters, e.g. before `CTGJoinActiveCTGs` (p.98).
15. **`DetermineBranchesThatCreateIslands` overwrites the Selected field.** With a blank filename it forces SetSelectedOnLines=YES (p.73, p.73).
16. **`ClearSmallIslands` de-energizes by opening generators** in every island except the one with the most buses (p.42).
17. **`Scale` only touches objects whose bus/area/zone/owner has Scale=YES.** Set and reset that field around each call, as in the doc's example. Numeric parameters scale the aggregate, and field-name parameters scale per object (p.39, p.39, p.40).
18. **`SetScheduledVoltageForABus` also rewrites the setpoints of regulating gens and switched shunts** (p.50).
19. **`WeatherPFWModelsSetInputsAndApply` changes case values** such as gen MaxMW. Its `SolvePowerFlow` argument is **required** (p.150).
20. **Time step:** Load* commands delete existing timepoints and Append* commands keep them. B3D defaults to "GIC Only (No Power Flow)". `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet` clears prior fields for the type, while `SetByObject` unions. Changing TimeDomainSelected deletes saved results, and the selection lives in the .tsb, not the .pwb (p.143, p.141, p.143, p.145, p.146, p.146).
21. **`ATCDetermine` and `ATCDetermineMultipleDirections` have opposite `DoMultipleScenarios` defaults**: YES if scenarios exist versus NO (p.103, p.104). `ATCWriteToExcel`/`ATCWriteToText` can write **blank** results without an explicit field list (p.108).
22. **An Area SET_TO contingency action needs manually set options.** Island-based AGC must be disabled, make-up power must be "Same as Power Flow case", and AGC must not be disabled. "Simulator does not automatically set these options" (p.180).
23. **The Label field wins over key fields** whenever it is present in a DATA list (p.162).
24. **SimAuto limits:** `<PROMPT>` filenames, `MessageBox` and `ObjectFieldsInputDialog` fail, and `ExitProgram` should not be used (p.17, p.64, p.64, p.19).
25. **Smart quotes break parsing** (p.15). `StopAuxFile;` silently comments out everything after it (p.20).
26. **Document gaps and errors worth knowing:**
    - `CTGWriteResultsAndOptions` lists a `UseConcise` parameter that has no description (p.100 vs pp.100-101).
    - `SaveCase` lists only `PWB16-PWB23` explicitly, plus `PWB` = latest (p.37).
    - `ResetToFlatStart`'s intro reuses SolvePowerFlow's "conditional response" wording, which does not apply (p.59).
    - `DiffCaseWriteRemovedEPC`'s rename note names the wrong old command (p.57).
    - `MergeLineTerminals` says "multi-section lines" in its filter text (p.47).
    - `SetElseCreateData` is dated "September ?, 2026" (p.31).
    - The `filtertype`/`prefilter` fields of FILTER DATA are shown only by example.
    - Key-less option-object addressing via SetData is undocumented (see Aux option syntax item 3).
27. **`CTGWriteAllOptions` does not save results.** It is fixed to opt6=NO (p.99), so use `CTGWriteResultsAndOptions` to capture violations.
28. **`LoadScript` ignores its CreateIfNotFound argument** (pp.24-25).
29. **`EstimateVoltages` errors on a blank filter** and needs some buses outside the filter (p.58).

# Reference: steady-state study options, and the PowerWorld object-field export

## Abstract

The entry point for changing how any PowerWorld study runs ("200 iterations", "report islands",
"more SCOPF loops", "DC"): per study, which option object and command control it, with each
key field tagged verified, documented or schema-only. The exhaustive field and command lists
live on two companion pages; the Simulator 25 field export sits beside this page.

## Content

### The field export

`references/powerworld-object-fields-v25.xlsx` is PowerWorld's own case-object field list,
exported from **Simulator 25 (beta)** on 2026-09-12. One sheet, `ObjectFields`: **1,026 object
types and about 101,000 fields**. It is a schema, not case data. The field list changes between
Simulator versions; re-export rather than trust it on another build.

An object's header row carries the name in column A; its fields follow on rows with column A
blank. Columns:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| Key/Required Fields | `*1*`, `*2*`… primary key parts in order; `*A*` alternate key; `**` required to create the object. Suffixes (`*2B*`) and a bare `<` also appear; the export does not define them |
| Variable Name | the name esapp `pw[...]`, `GetParametersMultipleElement` and aux `SetData` use. A `:N` suffix is a separate field (`MaxItr:1`), spelled `MaxItr__1` as a Python attribute |
| Concise Variable Name | a second name for the same field — `DCPFMode` and `DCApprox` are one field |
| Available Field List | the GUI path, e.g. `Inner Power Flow Loop\Max Iterations` — search this to go from a dialog label to a field |
| Enterable | `Yes` = writable; `AUX/Paste` = writable only through an aux file or paste; blank = read-only |

Look a field up without opening Excel:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("powerworld-object-fields-v25.xlsx")
df["Object Type"] = df["Object Type"].ffill()
f = df[df["Variable Name"].notna()]
f[f["Object Type"].eq("Shunt") & f["Key/Required Fields"].notna()]   # keys + required
f[f["Description"].str.contains("island", case=False, na=False)]     # search by meaning
```

**Worked example of why the export matters.** "Add a shunt to an area": `Shunt` is keyed
`BusNum` (`*1*`) + `ShuntID` (`*2B*`) and requires `SSCMode`, `SSNMVR`, `SSStatus` (`**`). It
carries **two** area fields: `AreaNum` ("Area\Num of Shunt", writable — the shunt's own area
assignment, which may differ from its bus's) and `AreaNum:1` ("Area\Num of Bus", read-only).
Writing `AreaNum` changes which area the shunt is accounted to, not where it connects. To put a
shunt electrically inside an area, create it at a bus in that area.

### How to set any option object

Option objects (`Sim_Solution_Options`, `CTG_Options`, `OPF_Options`, `Distributed_Options`,
`Limit_Monitoring_Options`, `CTG_AutoInsert_Options`) are single-record and keyless.

- esapp: `pw.esa.SetData("CTG_Options", ["Field"], ["Value"])`, or the indexable
  `pw[Sim_Solution_Options, "Field"] = value`.
- aux / script: `SetData(CTG_Options, [Field], [Value]);`
- **Read the value back after every write.** `SetData` reports success on writes that change
  nothing ([opf-preconditions](../concepts/opf-preconditions.md)).
- Every option object has a `<Obj>_Value` twin (`VariableName` / `ValueField`), a name/value table
  form. Schema only; nothing here uses it.

- **The aux document never says how to address a keyless object.** It states that `SetData` with
  no filter needs key fields "to identify the one object", and `ALL` means every object. In
  practice keyless `SetData(Sim_Solution_Options, [f], [v]);` with no filter is used across these
  pages; the read-back is what proves each write, not the call returning.
- Field names: the aux parser accepts the variable name or the concise name.

**Precedence** (aux-file-format document, p.183): a contingency reads its solution options from
(1) its own `Contingency` record, then (2) `CTG_Options`, then (3) global `Sim_Solution_Options` —
global ranks **last**. Levels 1 and 2 are written in aux as a two-line
`<SUBDATA Sim_Solution_Options>` block (field names, then values) inside the record, or as the
`CTGSolutionOptions` string, which is enterable only via AUX/Paste.

### Every study at a glance

Commands with full parameters are on [powerworld-study-commands](powerworld-study-commands.md); every field of every option
object is on [powerworld-option-objects-v25](powerworld-option-objects-v25.md).

| study | option object(s) | run / control with |
|---|---|---|
| AC power flow | `Sim_Solution_Options`, `Limit_Monitoring_Options` | `SolvePowerFlow(RECTNEWT\|POLARNEWTON\|GAUSSSEIDEL\|FASTDEC\|ROBUST, okAux, failAux)`, `ResetToFlatStart`, `StoreState` / `RestoreState(USER\|BEFOREFAILED\|LASTSUCCESSFUL)` |
| DC power flow | `Sim_Solution_Options` (`DCPFModelType`) | `SolvePowerFlow(DC)` — the case **stays** DC until an AC method is used |
| contingency (N-1) | `CTG_Options`, `CTG_AutoInsert_Options`, `LimitSet`, `Distributed_Options` | `CTGAutoInsert`, `CTGSolveAll(DoDistributed, ClearAllResults)`, `CTGSetAsReference`, `CTGWriteResultsAndOptions` |
| N-1-1 / combo | `CTGPrimary_Options` | `CTGPrimaryAutoInsert`, `CTGComboSolveAll` |
| OPF | `OPF_Options`, plus `Area.BGAGC`, `Gen.GenAGCAble`, cost data | `InitializePrimalLP`, `SolvePrimalLP`, `SolveSinglePrimalLPOuterLoop` |
| SCOPF | `OPF_Options` (`SCOPF*`), `CTG_Options` | `SolveFullSCOPF(POWERFLOW\|OPF, …)` |
| unit commitment | `UC_Options` | options only; the aux document never mentions unit commitment |
| PTDF / LODF / shift factors | `PTDF_Options`, `LODF_Options`, `TLR_Options` | `CalculatePTDF`, `CalculateLODF`, `CalculateLODFMatrix`, `CalculateLODFScreening`, `CalculateShiftFactors` — LODF is DC/DCPS only |
| voltage and loss sensitivity | — | `CalculateVoltSense`, `CalculateVoltSelfSense`, `CalculateTapSense`, `CalculateLossSense` |
| ATC | `ATC_Options` | `ATCDetermine`, `ATCDetermineMultipleDirections` (opposite `DoMultipleScenarios` defaults) |
| PV / QV curves | `PVCurve_Options`, `QVCurve_Options` | `PVSetSourceAndSink`, `PVRun`, `QVRun` |
| scaling load or generation | `Scale_Options` | `Scale(LOAD\|GEN\|INJECTIONGROUP\|BUSSHUNT, MW\|FACTOR, [..], BUS\|AREA\|ZONE\|OWNER)` — only objects whose marker has `Scale = YES` |
| islands and topology | — | `DetermineBranchesThatCreateIslands`, `FindRadialBusPaths`, `DeterminePathDistance` |
| equivalencing | `Equiv_Options` | `Equivalence` (buses flagged `Equiv`) |
| fault | `Fault_Options` | `Fault`, `FaultAutoInsert` |
| time step | `Time_Step_Simulation_Options` | `TimeStepLoadPWW` (deletes existing timepoints), `TimeStepDoRun` |
| weather | `Weather_Options` | `WeatherPWWLoadForDateTimeUTC`, `WeatherPFWModelsSetInputsAndApply`, `TemperatureLimitsBranchUpdate` |
| scheduled actions | `ScheduledActions_Options` | `ApplyScheduledActionsAt`, `SetScheduleWindow` |

**Silent behaviours that break automation** (full list of 29 on [powerworld-study-commands](powerworld-study-commands.md)):

- `SetData` with no filter edits **one** object found by key fields; use `ALL` for every object.
  `Delete` with no filter deletes **every** object of the type.
- `CTGSolveAll` clears results of **skipped** contingencies too (`ClearAllResults` defaults YES).
- `CTGSolve` leaves the case in the post-contingency state; call `CTGRestoreReference`.
- `ResetToFlatStart` with defaults also sets **generator voltage setpoints** to 1.0 pu.
- `RestoreState(BEFOREFAILED)` vanishes after any later successful solve.
- `CTGAutoInsert`, `FaultAutoInsert`, `Equivalence` take no parameters: stale option values from
  an earlier session silently drive them.
- Contingencies run in creation order, not name order (`CTGSort` first).
- Most Save commands **append** by default.
- `CalculateShiftFactors` defaults to `AbortOnError = YES`, which stops the rest of the aux file.

**Provenance tags below:** **V** = a page records it confirmed on a live case · **D** = a page
states it, not live-tested · **S** = the field exists in the export with PowerWorld's
description; behaviour not tested here.

### A. Power flow — `Sim_Solution_Options`

| want | field | tag |
|---|---|---|
| more Newton iterations | `MaxItr` (inner loop) · `MaxItr:1` (voltage-control loop) | S |
| tolerance | `ConvergenceTol` (**per unit**: 0.1 MVA at 100 MVA base = 0.001) · `ConvergenceTol:2` (MVA) | S |
| controls on/off | `ChkTaps`, `ChkShunts`, `ChkShunts:1` (SVC), `ChkPhaseShifters`, `ChkVars` / `ChkVars:1` (gen Mvar check / back-off), `DisableGenMVRCheck`, `EnforceGenMWLimits` | S |
| stop oscillating controls | `PreventOscillations` | S |
| islands | `AllowMultIslands` (auto slack per island) · `EvalSolutionIsland` / `:1` | S |
| load model at low voltage | `MinVoltSLoad` / `MinVoltILoad` — **hides voltage collapse** by shedding load | V 2026-09-23 |
| flat start | `FlatStart` is **ignored by script solves** (PowerWorld's own description). Call `ResetToFlatStart` | S + D |
| DC power flow | script `SolvePowerFlow(DC)`, then check every `BusPUVolt == 1.0` | V |

⚠️ **`DCPFMode` (concise name `DCApprox`) is one field, and writing it is not enough.** Measured
2026-09-23 on a live case: `DCApprox = YES` did **not** make
`SolvePowerFlow()` run DC. Only `SolvePowerFlow(DC)` is verified. Any DC-contingency or DC-SCOPF
sequence that relies on the flag alone may have run an AC base case.

### B. Contingency — `CTG_Options`, `LimitSet`, `Area`

| want | object.field | tag |
|---|---|---|
| AC or DC contingency | `CTG_Options.CTG_CalculationMethod` = `AC` / `DC` / `DCPS`. In DC power-flow mode only `AC` is offered and contingencies are evaluated by sensitivities, not applied | S, used live |
| base-case violations | `CTG_WhatToDoWithBC`: 0 don't report · 1 report all · 2 change-from-base | V (Synth2k) |
| voltage band post-CTG | `LimitSet.LSCtgPULow` / `LSCtgPUHigh` — `SetData` needs the full row | V |
| rate set | `LimitSet.LSLineRateSet` (normal) / `LSLineRateSet:1` (CTG) | V 2026-08-17 |
| which areas are monitored | `Area.BGReportLimits`. `CTG_ReportMonitoredAreas` is a **decoy** (text report only) | V 2026-08-17 |

**Islands: no single check covers them all** (measured 2026-09-28, regional synthetic planning
model). `Contingency.LoadMW` / `GenMW` catch islands PowerWorld **drops**; `CTG_Options.Include`
fires "Island Solved" rows for self-sustaining pockets it keeps **energized**; the script
`DetermineBranchesThatCreateIslands` catches both plus 0-MW pockets. Gate an island check on MW
only when the pocket carries MW. `Contingency.LoadMW:2` is load lost to the `MinVoltSLoad` model,
not to islanding — read it separately.

**Building the set** — `CTG_AutoInsert_Options`: `ElementType` is `BRANCH` or `GENERATOR`, never
`GEN` (silently ignored, V). On the Simulator 25 beta build used 2026-09-28, `CTGAutoInsert`
inserted **zero** contingencies with no error: always count the result against lines plus
two-winding transformers.

| DC SCOPF | `CTG_CalculationMethod = DC` **and** the case genuinely in DC mode (`SolvePowerFlow(DC)`, see the ⚠️ in A) | not verified |

**There is no SCOPF "inner loop" count.** The export has `SCOPFMaxOuterLoopItr` and the per-LP
`OPF_MaxLPIterations`, nothing else. `SCOPFOuterLoopType` exists but its values are undocumented.

### E. After the run

- Read violations with an explicit field list — `pw[ViolationCTG, fields]`, never bare. Watch
  `LimViolCat` (`Unsolved` is not a violation) and `AreaNum = 0` on tie lines
  ([reading-violationctg](../methods/reading-violationctg.md)).
- Rank devices by how far past the limit their outages push things
  ([ranking-new-devices-by-severity](../methods/ranking-new-devices-by-severity.md)).
- Shrink the set: `CTGSkip` only partitions; `Delete(Contingency, "CTGViol = 0")` reduces. Back
  up with `CTGWriteAuxUsingOptions` first ([reducing-a-contingency-set](../methods/reducing-a-contingency-set.md)).
- Screen fast with LODFs before a full AC run ([lodf](../concepts/lodf.md)).

### Gaps — nothing here documents these

- Value vocabularies for `SCOPFOuterLoopType`, `OPF_GenCostModel`, `OPF_LoadControlPFOption`,
  `SuperArea.BGAGC` — the export's description is only the field name.
- An AC or DC SCOPF verified end to end, with a date.
- Post-contingency governor response, load throw-over and switched-shunt behaviour beyond
  `UseAreaPartsMakeUpPower`.
- OPF reserve requirement and bid fields beyond `OPFIncludeReserveRequirements`.
- The meaning of the `<` marker and key suffixes like `*2B*` in the export.

# Reference: time-step-simulation backend

> ⚠️ **TimeStep ≠ Transient Stability.** This is PowerWorld's **TimeStep** weather
> feature (quasi-static `.pww` weather → hourly MW), driven by the low-level `esapp`
> `TimeStep*` script commands. It is **NOT** a transient-stability/dynamics study and
> does **NOT** use esapp's `pw.ts_solve` / `TSWatch` / `ContingencyBuilder` API (see the
> "TS" warning on [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md)). The "TS" in the `TSPFWModelString` field means *TimeStep*,
> not Transient Stability. Do not import or call any transient-stability function here.

## Abstract

Code-reconstruction reference for the time step simulation project — the `_simulation_worker` PowerWorld call sequence (weather load → generator selection → field-save wrapper → run → export), `_GEN_PARAM` field list, `process_results` CSV post-processing with 8 header rows skipped, and both series and parallel `main.py` orchestration variants. Covers every SimAuto command, required wrapper (`TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyStart`/`Finish`), and gotcha in enough detail to regenerate working simulation code from scratch. Read this in full only when writing or regenerating code for time step simulation; for the gist, use the project page.

## Connections

- **Up:** time step simulation (the project) + [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [pww-data](../concepts/pww-data.md), pfw copperplate, [timestep-simulation](../concepts/timestep-simulation.md), [timestep-simulation-setup](../methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md)

## Content

> **Library note — prefer `esapp` over `esa`.** This repo imports the standalone `esa` (Easy SimAuto) package. For new or regenerated code, prefer **`esapp` (ESA++)**: it wraps the **same** PowerWorld SimAuto server, and esapp exposes each of those SCRIPT commands as a typed named method (`pw.esa.TimeStepDoRun()`), which is what you should call — see [esapp-script-command-wrappers](../concepts/esapp-script-command-wrappers.md) — an agent reasons about it more reliably. Swap esa's data helpers (`GetParametersMultipleElement`, `change_parameters_multiple_element_df`, `get_key_field_list`) for esapp's bracket interface (`pw[Type, fields]`, `pw[Type] = df`, `Type.keys()`). See [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md). (Library choice only — unrelated to the TimeStep-vs-Transient-Stability distinction.)

Code-reconstruction knowledge for time step simulation. Given a plain prompt
("run the renewable sim on the Synth2k case"), an agent reads this page and
writes WORKING code. Everything here is verified against the real source on disk
(`C:\path\to\time-step-simulation`). Hub: [Home](../index.md).

The whole engine is two functions in `function.py`: `_simulation_worker(...)` (drives
PowerWorld) and `process_results(...)` (post-processes the CSV). `main.py` /
`parallel/main.py` are just CLI + grouping + I/O around them. The time math lives in
`time_utils.py`. **`parallel/function.py` is byte-identical to `function.py`** — the
engine is shared; only the `main.py` orchestration differs.

---

## 0. Imports & environment (get these wrong and nothing runs)

- **`from esapp import PowerWorld`** — esapp (ESA++) wraps the same PowerWorld SimAuto
  server as the older standalone `esa` package, and is the one to write. `pw.esa` is
  esapp's own raw SimAuto handle, and each SCRIPT command below is exposed as a typed named
  method (`pw.esa.TimeStepDoRun()`) — call those, not a hand-written script string. Only the
  data helpers differ beyond that: the bracket interface replaces esa's
  `GetParametersMultipleElement` / `change_parameters_multiple_element_df`.
- The import is **lazy** — done *inside* `_simulation_worker`, not at module top —
  so importing `function.py` never requires PowerWorld to be installed. Keep it lazy
  if you regenerate this.
- **Windows-only.** esapp drives PowerWorld Simulator through SimAuto (COM). No
  PowerWorld → no run.
- `numpy` is imported at module top with `# noqa: F401` purely "for parity with
  downstream tooling" — it's not used directly in `function.py`. `pandas` is used.
- `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))` is done so
  `from time_utils import convert_to_utc` resolves regardless of CWD.

```python
import os, sys, shutil, tempfile
import numpy as np   # noqa: F401
import pandas as pd
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
from time_utils import convert_to_utc
# ... inside the worker:
from esapp import PowerWorld       # lazy, only when actually simulating
from esapp.components import Gen
```

---

## 1. `_GEN_PARAM` — the generator field list (verbatim)

These extra fields are appended to the case's key fields and pulled from every
generator. Verbatim from `function.py:28-32`:

```python
_GEN_PARAM = [
    'Latitude', 'Longitude', 'GenUnitType', 'GenFuelType',
    'ZoneName', 'AreaName', 'TSPFWModelString', 'GenMWMax',
    'Selected', 'CustomString:1', 'CustomString:2',
]
```

Why each field is pulled:

| Field | Used for |
|---|---|
| `Latitude`, `Longitude` | output header rows (rows 7 & 8); also fed by `PFW_Insertion` to assign ISO region |
| `GenUnitType` | pulled for completeness; not used downstream in `function.py` |
| `GenFuelType` | **the renewable selector** — `.str.contains('WND\|SUN')` picks wind/solar; also splits solar (`SUN`) vs wind (`WND`) |
| `ZoneName` | output header "State" row (label maps `ZoneName` → "State") |
| `AreaName` | output header "Utility" row (label maps `AreaName` → "Utility") |
| `TSPFWModelString` | output header "PV / Wind Types" row — the unit's PFW model string |
| `GenMWMax` | output header "Gen Max MW" row |
| `Selected` | toggled to `'YES'` for renewables, then used to drive `TimeDomainSelected` |
| `CustomString:1` | pulled but not used in `function.py` |
| `CustomString:2` | output header "ISO" row (label maps `CustomString:2` → "ISO"); populated by `PFW_Insertion` spatial join |

Key fields come from `Gen.keys()` (typically `BusNum`, `GenID`)
and are **prepended**, so the resulting `gen` DataFrame has columns
`[<key fields>] + _GEN_PARAM`.

> ⚠️ **This prepend is not optional.** Later the code pushes `gen` back with
> `pw[Gen] = gen` (twice — to set `Selected` and
> `TimeDomainSelected`). PowerWorld matches each row to a generator by its key fields, so
> if `BusNum`/`GenID` weren't in the DataFrame the write would **silently do nothing** and
> no generators would be selected. Always keep the key columns in any DataFrame you write
> back. (Same rule on the esapp bracket path — see [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md).)

---

## 2. `_simulation_worker` — the FULL backend sequence, IN ORDER

Signature: `_simulation_worker(case_path, pww_list, result_csv) -> gen (DataFrame)`.
Returns the generator metadata DataFrame (the caller needs it for `process_results`).
Verbatim mechanics from `function.py:35-83`:

```python
def _simulation_worker(case_path, pww_list, result_csv):
    from esapp import PowerWorld                     # lazy import
    from esapp.components import Gen
    tmp_case = None
    try:
        # (a) temp-copy the case so parallel runs never fight over the .pwb lock
        tmp_fd, tmp_case = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.PWB')
        os.close(tmp_fd)
        shutil.copy2(case_path, tmp_case)

        # (b) open the temp case
        pw = PowerWorld(tmp_case)

        # (c) pull generator metadata (key fields + _GEN_PARAM)
        gen_param = list(Gen.keys()) + _GEN_PARAM
        gen = pw[Gen, gen_param]

        # (d) load weather file(s): first = Load, rest = Append
        pw.esa.TimeStepLoadPWW(pww_list[0], "Weather Only")
        for pww in pww_list[1:]:
            pw.esa.TimeStepAppendPWW(pww, "Weather Only")

        # (e) EDIT mode: mark renewables Selected = YES, push back
        pw.esa.EnterMode("EDIT")
        gen.loc[gen['GenFuelType'].str.contains('WND|SUN', na=False), 'Selected'] = 'YES'
        pw[Gen] = gen
        pw.esa.EnterMode("RUN")

        # (f) declare which fields to save — MUST be wrapped (see callout below)
        pw.esa.TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyStart()
        gen.loc[gen['Selected'] == 'YES', 'TimeDomainSelected'] = 'YES'
        pw[Gen] = gen
        pw.esa.TimeStepSaveFieldsSet(
            "GEN",
            ["BGGenMWFuelTypeGeneric:10", "BGGenMWFuelTypeGeneric:12"],
            "SELECTED",
        )
        pw.esa.TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyFinish()

        # (g) run + export
        pw.esa.TimeStepDoRun()
        pw.esa.TimeStepSaveResultsByTypeCSV("gen", result_csv)
        pw.esa.CloseCase()
        return gen
    finally:
        # (h) always delete the temp case
        if tmp_case and os.path.exists(tmp_case):
            try:
                os.remove(tmp_case)
            except OSError:
                pass
```

Step-by-step, every SimAuto call / SAW method in execution order:

1. `tempfile.mkstemp(suffix='.PWB')` → `os.close(fd)` → `shutil.copy2(case_path, tmp_case)` — work on a private temp copy, never the original `.pwb`.
2. `pw = PowerWorld(tmp_case)` — open the case.
3. `gen_param = list(Gen.keys()) + _GEN_PARAM`
4. `gen = pw[Gen, gen_param]` — DataFrame of all gens.
5. `pw.esa.TimeStepLoadPWW(pww0, "Weather Only")` — load first weather file.
6. for each remaining pww: `pw.esa.TimeStepAppendPWW(pww, "Weather Only")` — append.
7. `pw.esa.EnterMode("EDIT")`
8. set `gen['Selected'] = 'YES'` where `GenFuelType` contains `WND|SUN`.
9. `pw[Gen] = gen` — push selection into the case.
10. `pw.esa.EnterMode("RUN")`
11. **`pw.esa.TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyStart()`** ← opens the save-field edit transaction.
12. set `gen['TimeDomainSelected'] = 'YES'` where `Selected == 'YES'`.
13. `pw[Gen] = gen` — push `TimeDomainSelected`.
14. `pw.esa.TimeStepSaveFieldsSet("GEN", ["BGGenMWFuelTypeGeneric:10", "BGGenMWFuelTypeGeneric:12"], "SELECTED")` — choose the two MW-by-fuel-type fields to save for selected gens.
15. **`pw.esa.TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyFinish()`** ← closes the transaction.
16. `pw.esa.TimeStepDoRun()` — run the time-step simulation.
17. `pw.esa.TimeStepSaveResultsByTypeCSV("gen", result_csv)` — export gen results to CSV.
18. `pw.esa.CloseCase()`.
19. `finally:` delete `tmp_case`.

### ⚠️ REQUIRED wrapper — do not drop it

```
TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyStart;
   ... set TimeDomainSelected = YES + TimeStepSaveFieldsSet(...) ...
TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyFinish;
```

The `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet` + `TimeDomainSelected` changes **MUST** be bracketed by
`TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyStart;` … `TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyFinish;`. Without this
wrapper the field-save selection **silently fails** — the sim runs, the CSV is
written, but the per-generator MW columns you wanted are missing/empty. There is no
error; you just get a useless file. If you regenerate this code, keep the Start/Finish
pair around steps 11–15 exactly.

### Field codes `BGGenMWFuelTypeGeneric:10` / `:12`

These are the two PowerWorld TimeStep result fields saved per selected generator —
"generator MW by generic fuel type", indices `10` and `12`. Downstream
`process_results` splits output columns by the literal substrings `'solar'` and
`'wind'` in the exported CSV column names, so the two indices correspond to the solar
and wind MW outputs.
> **UNVERIFIED:** needs confirmation -- which of `:10` / `:12` is solar vs wind in the PowerWorld fuel-type
> generic enumeration (code only relies on the column-name token, not the index).

### `pww_list` semantics

`pww_list[0]` → `TimeStepLoadPWW`; every subsequent entry → `TimeStepAppendPWW`. Both
use the `"Weather Only"` mode argument. In practice the callers pass **one PWW per
worker call** (`[pww]`) and concatenate the resulting CSVs in pandas afterward — the
Append branch exists but the production paths feed single-file lists and stitch
quarters at the DataFrame level (see §4).

---

## 3. `process_results(gen, df)` — CSV → (solar_df, wind_df)

Signature: `process_results(gen, df) -> (solar_df, wind_df)`. `gen` is the DataFrame
returned by the worker; `df` is the raw exported CSV read back via `pd.read_csv`.
Verbatim from `function.py:86-152`.

### 3a. Time conversion first
`result = convert_to_utc(df)` — replaces the first column (Excel-serial CST
timestamps) with ISO-8601 UTC strings (see §6).

### 3b. The 8 metadata header rows
Eight rows are prepended above the time-series. `row_names` are the row labels;
`labels` are the `gen` columns each row pulls its values from (positional zip):

```python
row_names = ['ISO', 'PV / Wind', 'PV / Wind Types', 'Gen Max MW', 'State', 'Utility',
             'Latitude', 'Longitude']
labels    = ['CustomString:2', 'GenFuelType', 'TSPFWModelString',
             'GenMWMax', 'ZoneName', 'AreaName', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']
```

| Header row | Source `gen` column |
|---|---|
| ISO | `CustomString:2` |
| PV / Wind | `GenFuelType` |
| PV / Wind Types | `TSPFWModelString` |
| Gen Max MW | `GenMWMax` |
| State | `ZoneName` |
| Utility | `AreaName` |
| Latitude | `Latitude` |
| Longitude | `Longitude` |

### 3c. `(BusNum, GenID)` meta_lookup
An O(1) dict over only the renewable rows, keyed by `(int(BusNum), str(GenID))`:

```python
ren_mask = gen['GenFuelType'].str.contains('WND|SUN', na=False)
meta_lookup = {
    (int(row['BusNum']), str(row['GenID'])): row
    for _, row in gen[ren_mask].iterrows()
}
```

### 3d. Header build — per-column branch logic
Walk every column of `result` once:

- column == `'DateTimeUTCExcelFormat'` → each header row gets its own label (the row name itself) in this column.
- column contains `'Gen'` → parse `parts = col.split(' ')`; `busnum = int(parts[2].replace("'", ""))`, `genid = parts[3].replace("'", "")`. On `IndexError`/`ValueError` → fill `'N/A'`. Otherwise look up `meta_lookup[(busnum, genid)]` and fill each header row from its mapped label (`'N/A'` if not found).
- any other column → fill `''` (empty) for all header rows.

The column-name shape PowerWorld emits is therefore like `... Gen '<BusNum>' '<GenID>' ...` (quoted bus and id at `parts[2]`/`parts[3]`), with `'solar'`/`'wind'` somewhere in the name. Header rows are assembled into `header_df` and `pd.concat([header_df, result], ignore_index=True)` → `result_1`.

### 3e. Solar / wind split by token matching
```python
PV_gen = gen[gen['GenFuelType'].str.contains('SUN', na=False)]
WT_gen = gen[gen['GenFuelType'].str.contains('WND', na=False)]

solar_tokens = {f"'{int(r['BusNum'])}' '{r['GenID']}'" for _, r in PV_gen.iterrows()}
wind_tokens  = {f"'{int(r['BusNum'])}' '{r['GenID']}'" for _, r in WT_gen.iterrows()}

solar_columns = ['DateTimeUTCExcelFormat'] + [
    c for c in result_1.columns
    if 'solar' in c.lower() and any(tok in c for tok in solar_tokens)]
wind_columns = ['DateTimeUTCExcelFormat'] + [
    c for c in result_1.columns
    if 'wind' in c.lower() and any(tok in c for tok in wind_tokens)]

return result_1[solar_columns], result_1[wind_columns]
```

A column lands in the solar output iff its name contains `'solar'` (case-insensitive)
**AND** contains a `'<BusNum>' '<GenID>'` token of a `SUN` generator; symmetric for
wind/`WND`. The timestamp column `DateTimeUTCExcelFormat` is always kept first in both.
Both returned frames carry the 8 header rows on top.

---

## 4. `main.py` (series) — grouping, run loop, output naming

- CLI args (`parse_args`): `--case` (required), mutually-exclusive **required** group
  `--pww FILE...` xor `--pww-dir DIR`, plus `--year YYYY` (int, filters `--pww-dir`),
  `--output-dir`, `--yes/-y` (skip the `input()` confirm prompt).
- Default output: `Results/` next to `main.py` (`os.path.join(_script_dir, "Results")`).
- **Grouping (`_group_files`)**: for each file, `re.search(r"(\d{4})_Q\d", name)`.
  Matches (quarter files like `NorthAmerica2025_Q1.pww`) are grouped by **year** so all
  4 quarters run as one logical run (`groups[year] = [...]`). Non-matches (e.g. forecast
  files) become individual runs keyed by their filename stem. With `--pww-dir`, only
  `.pww` files are listed and `year_filter=args.year` drops other years.
- **Run loop**: for each `(key, pww_list)`:
  - `is_historical = bool(re.search(r"\d{4}_Q\d", basename(pww_list[0])))`.
  - `out_stem = f"Historical_{key}"` if historical else `key` (forecast stems already
    start with `Forecast_`, so don't double-prefix).
  - Outputs: `{out_stem}_solar.csv`, `{out_stem}_wind.csv` in `output_dir`.
  - **Resume-safe skip**: if BOTH solar and wind CSVs already exist → skip (delete to re-run).
  - Runs each pww **one at a time** via `_simulation_worker(args.case, [pww], q_csv)`
    into `_raw_<qname>.csv`, reads each back with `pd.read_csv`, removes the temp csv,
    `pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)`, then `process_results(gen, df)` → write
    `solar_path` / `wind_path`. `gen` from the last quarter is reused (identical per case).
  - Wrapped in try/except → prints error + `traceback.print_exc()`, continues to next group.

---

## 5. `parallel/main.py` — the parallel variant

Same engine (`parallel/function.py`); only orchestration differs. What can produce a wrong
or failed run:

- **Cap `--workers` at what the PowerWorld licence and RAM allow.** Each worker drives its
  own SimAuto instance against its own temp copy of the case — the temp-copy in
  `_simulation_worker` is what makes concurrency safe.
- **Workers must stay top-level and import the engine inside the child.** Windows spawn
  needs them picklable, and the parent must never load PowerWorld.
- **Incomplete years are skipped silently** — only years with all four quarters become
  groups, and a group with any failed sim skips assembly.
- **Resume-safe:** a group whose solar *and* wind CSVs both exist is skipped, so a rerun
  after a partial failure does not redo finished work.

## 6. `time_utils.py` — time math ("settled, don't change")

Verified against real runs; **do not change without a clear reason.** Two facts that change
an answer:

- **The CST→UTC conversion applies a DST correction, not a fixed offset.** Column 0 is
  Excel-serial in CST (UTC-6), and one hour comes off inside US DST (second Sunday in March
  02:00 → first Sunday in November 02:00) before rounding to the hour. Treating the column
  as a flat UTC-6 offset shifts every summer timestamp by an hour.
- **`interpolate_to_hourly` exists but is NOT called** in the current run path. It fills
  3-hour forecast gaps; assuming it ran is how a gapped forecast series gets read as hourly.
## 7. Gotchas checklist (regenerate-safe)

- ✅ `from esapp import PowerWorld` — **esapp, not the standalone `esa`**. Same SimAuto
  underneath; do not mix the two in one script.
- ✅ **Windows + PowerWorld only** (SimAuto/COM).
- ✅ **Temp-copy the case** (`mkstemp('.PWB')` + `shutil.copy2`) and run against the
  copy; delete in `finally`. This is what makes parallel runs lock-safe.
- ✅ **`TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyStart;` … `TIMESTEPSaveSelectedModifyFinish;`** must
  wrap the `TimeStepSaveFieldsSet` + `TimeDomainSelected` edits, or saved fields
  silently come back empty.
- ✅ Selection is two-stage: `Selected='YES'` (EDIT mode) for renewables, then
  `TimeDomainSelected='YES'` (inside the Save-Modify wrapper) for those same gens.
- ✅ `EnterMode(EDIT)` before pushing `Selected`; `EnterMode(RUN)` before the
  Save-Modify wrapper and the run.
- ✅ Renewable selector everywhere: `GenFuelType.str.contains('WND|SUN', na=False)`;
  solar = `SUN`, wind = `WND`.
- ✅ **Resume-safe skip**: a run is skipped iff BOTH its solar and wind CSVs exist.
- ✅ **Historical grouping** keys off `re.search(r"(\d{4})_Q\d", name)` — quarter files
  group by year and are named `Historical_{year}_{solar,wind}.csv`; anything else runs
  individually under its stem. Keep `_group_files` and the `is_historical` check in sync.
- ✅ Confirmation prompt via `input()` unless `--yes/-y`; parallel adds `--workers`.
- ✅ Parallel workers must stay **top-level / picklable** and import `function` inside
  the child process (Windows spawn).
