"""Write an eval case's prompt.md and case.yaml from its fixture, so the findings travel inline.

    python tools/case-audit-dev/write_prompt.py evals/<case> [evals/<case> ...]

Run it after replay.py or scrub_findings.py has written the case's fixtures/findings.md. The eval
sandbox does not expose `context.add_dirs` to the agent on native Windows, and `scaffold_script`
fails there, so the prompt carries the audit itself: the engineer's question (kept as it is), one
line saying the audit was already run, then findings.md verbatim in a fence. fixtures/ stays the
source of truth; the suite checks that each prompt still embeds it word for word.

The frontmatter also gets `append_system_prompt` (ROUTING): eval run 2 showed the main session
answering every case itself and never dispatching case-auditor. The question stays plain.
