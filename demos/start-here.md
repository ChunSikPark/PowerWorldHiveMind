# Demos: what to say, and what happens

## Abstract

Worked runs on a real 37-bus case (Synth40: 37 buses, 89 branches, 45 generators).
Every number on these pages came from an actual run — including the failures, which were
left in on purpose. Start with the one-line prompts below: you should not have to know
which page covers what.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [handling-errors](../methods/handling-errors.md) · [preflight-powerworld](../methods/preflight-powerworld.md) · [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md)

## Content

### Just say this

You do not need to name a function, a field, or a file. Say the thing you want:

| Say this | The agent will |
|---|---|
| *"Is PowerWorld working on this machine?"* | Run the 5-check preflight and tell you what is missing |
| *"Open my case and summarize it."* | Load it, solve, report buses/branches/generators and voltage range |
| *"Which branches are most heavily loaded?"* | AC solve, rank by percent of rating |
| *"Anything overloaded?"* | Solve and check limits, base case and N-1 |
| *"Run a DC power flow instead."* | Switch solver mode and re-solve |
| *"If line 27–29 trips, where does the flow go?"* | LODF, sentinel values filtered |
| *"How sensitive are the lines to a transfer from bus 23 to bus 26?"* | PTDF |
| *"Add a line between bus 27 and bus 31 and tell me if it helps N-1."* | Create it, verify it was really created, re-run N-1, compare |
| *"Run N-1 on everything."* | Auto-insert contingencies, solve, report violations |
| *"Build me a contingency file for the five most loaded lines."* | Generate an `.aux` and load it |
| *"Get February 2021 weather for Texas."* | Download a cropped `.pww` |
| *"How much wind and solar would these units produce?"* | Set up and run a TimeStep simulation |
| *"Run N-1, work out what's wrong, and tell me what to build to fix it."*  | Diagnose the cause, test candidate reinforcements, rank them, and say which to reject |
| *"Compare my 2016 and 2024 cases and tell me what the plan builds."* | Diff both, guard against renumbering artifacts, classify NEW / RETIRED / UPGRADED |
| *"Do the new devices in this plan cause violations?"* | Build a contingency set for just those devices, solve, and attribute correctly |
| *"Can this case run a weather study?"* | Check whether its renewable units carry PFW models |
| *"Save the case."* | Write it out — after asking where, since that is destructive |

If a prompt fails, that is a defect worth reporting. The routing is
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)'s job, not yours.

### The demos

| Demo | Shows |
|---|---|
| [comparing-planning-cases](comparing-planning-cases.md) | **Multi-case.** 2016 vs 2024: 691 new branches, 199 new generators, and a scoping trap that makes the naive answer 87% wrong |
| [violation-remediation](violation-remediation.md) | **The full study.** 12 violations diagnosed to one cause, five reinforcements tested and ranked, two of which make things worse |
| [adding-a-device](adding-a-device.md) | **Read this one.** Three attempts that succeeded and did nothing, then the fix. The silent-failure problem in full |
| [power-flow-and-sensitivities](power-flow-and-sensitivities.md) | AC, DC, LODF, PTDF — with the `1e8` sentinel and a two-step error recovery |
| [contingency-and-aux](contingency-and-aux.md) | N-1 from scratch, and generating a filter + contingency `.aux` automatically |
| [timestep-and-pfw](timestep-and-pfw.md) | Weather to megawatts: PFW models, TimeStep, and reading the output |

### Queries versus studies

The first few prompts above are queries — one number, one answer. The interesting ones
are studies: *diagnose the cause, propose a fix, apply it, re-verify, and report what you
rejected.*

That second kind is what this kit is really for. A voltage readout needs no knowledge
base. Knowing that reinforcing the most loaded branch can make N-1 **worse** — and having
measured it rather than argued it — does.

### Measuring whether this actually works — in progress

The traversal protocol claims a fresh agent needs three to five pages for a typical task.
**That is a design target, not yet a measured result.** The check:

1. Start a fresh session with no prior PowerWorld context, in a clean clone.
2. Give it one prompt from the table above.
3. Count the pages it opens before it writes code.

**Pass is fewer than 8 of 41.** Reading 25 means the router's traversal instructions are
too weak and belong in the next revision — a defect in this knowledge base, not in the
agent.

If you run it, the page count and the prompt you used are worth an issue on the
repository either way. A failure here is more useful than a pass.

### What every demo assumes

Preflight passed. If it did not, nothing here runs — see [preflight-powerworld](../methods/preflight-powerworld.md).

### The case used

```
Synth40.pwb
  37 buses, 89 branches, 45 generators, 27 loads
  1154.7 MW generation vs 1136.3 MW load
  voltage 0.9749 - 1.0034 pu, Sbase 100 MVA
  base case: 0 overloads
  N-1: 12 violations across 89 auto-inserted contingencies
```

It is small enough that a wrong answer is visibly wrong, which is exactly why it was
chosen. A synthetic case, so nothing here is sensitive.

### Two habits these demos are trying to teach

**Assert the effect, not the absence of an error.** PowerWorld will accept a malformed
request, report success, and do nothing. Count before, count after, assert the delta.

**Say what you did not do.** None of these demos saved the case. Every one of them says
so. An analysis that quietly wrote to disk is worse than one that quietly did not.
