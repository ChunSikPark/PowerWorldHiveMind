# Demo: Adding a line — and the silent failure that hides it

## Abstract

A complete worked run on a real 37-bus case. **Everything below actually happened**,
including three failed attempts that raised no error at all. This is the single most
important demo in the kit: `CreateData` accepts a malformed call, reports success, and
creates nothing. If you read only one demo, read this one.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md) · demos index
- **Across:** [adding-devices-esapp](../methods/adding-devices-esapp.md) · [handling-errors](../methods/handling-errors.md) · [esapp-environment](../concepts/esapp-environment.md)

## Content

### The user's prompt

> *"Add a line between bus 27 and bus 31 and tell me if it helps with N-1."*

That is all a user should have to say.

### Step 1 — establish the baseline

```python
from esapp import PowerWorld
from esapp.components import Branch, Bus, ViolationCTG

CASE = r"C:\path\to\Synth40.pwb"
pw = PowerWorld(CASE)
pw.pflow()

n0 = len(pw[Branch])
print("branches before:", n0)
```

```
branches before: 89
```

Baseline N-1, so there is something to compare against:

```python
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("CTGClearAllResults")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("CTGAutoInsert")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("CTGSolveAll")
print("base violations:", len(pw[ViolationCTG, ["CTGLabel", "LimViolPct"]]))
```

```
base violations: 12
```

### Step 2 — three attempts that all "succeeded" and did nothing

These are the natural things to try. Each ran without raising:

```python
# attempt A
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(
    'CreateData(BRANCH,[BusNum,BusNum:1,LineCircuit,LineR,LineX,LineC,LineLimMVA,LineStatus],'
    '[27,31,"9",0.01,0.05,0.0,100.0,"Closed"])')

# attempt B - fewer fields
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(
    'CreateData(BRANCH,[BusNum,BusNum:1,LineCircuit,LineR,LineX],[27,31,"8",0.01,0.05])')

# attempt C - same thing, but inside EDIT mode
pw.edit_mode()
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(
    'CreateData(BRANCH,[BusNum,BusNum:1,LineCircuit,LineR,LineX],[27,31,"7",0.01,0.05])')
pw.run_mode()
```

The observed result of all three:

```
  A: quoted circuit, Closed: no exception
     -> branches now 89
  B: no status field: no exception
     -> branches now 89
  C: in EDIT mode: no exception
     -> branches now 89
```

**No exception. No warning. No device.** The buses both exist, no branch 27–31 was
already there, and the call reported success three different ways.

An agent that trusts the absence of an error will now happily run N-1, get the same 12
violations, and report "adding this line does not help" — a conclusion drawn from a line
that was never added. That is the failure mode this whole knowledge base exists to
prevent.

### Step 3 — stop guessing, read the page

The fix is in [adding-devices-esapp](../methods/adding-devices-esapp.md), and it is not something you would arrive at by
trying variations:

1. Use the **`pw.esa.CreateData(...)` method**, not a `RunScriptCommand` string.
2. Supply **every** primary, secondary, and required field. For a `Branch` that means
   `BusName_NomVolt` for *both* ends, not just the bus numbers.
3. Supply **all three** MVA limits — `LineAMVA`, `LineAMVA:1`, `LineAMVA:2`. Giving only
   the A limit silently skips the branch.

```python
# build the name/nominal-voltage map first; both ends must resolve
nv = {int(r["BusNum"]): r["BusName_NomVolt"]
      for _, r in pw[Bus, ["BusName_NomVolt"]].iterrows()}

frm, to, mva = 27, 31, 100.0

pw.edit_mode()
pw.esa.CreateData(
    "Branch",
    ["BusNum", "BusName_NomVolt", "BusNum:1", "BusName_NomVolt:1", "LineCircuit",
     "LineR", "LineX", "LineAMVA", "LineAMVA:1", "LineAMVA:2", "LineStatus"],
    [frm, nv[frm], to, nv[to], "N1", 0.01, 0.05, mva, mva, mva, "Closed"])
pw.run_mode()

n1 = len(pw[Branch])
print(f"branches after: {n1}  (created {n1 - n0})")
assert n1 - n0 == 1, "CreateData silently skipped the device"
```

```
branches before: 89
branches after : 90   (created 1)
ASSERTION PASSED - device really created
```

### Step 4 — always assert the count

```python
assert n1 - n0 == expected, "CreateData silently skipped the device"
```

**Never skip this line.** It is the only thing standing between a silent no-op and a
confident wrong answer. Count before, count after, assert the difference. Do it for
every `CreateData` call, every time.

### Step 5 — answer the actual question

```python
pw.pflow()
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("CTGClearAllResults")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("CTGSolveAll")
print("violations with the new line:", len(pw[ViolationCTG, ["CTGLabel", "LimViolPct"]]))
```

```
N-1 violations WITH the new line: 10  (base case was 12)
```

### What to report back

> Added a 69 kV line from bus 27 to bus 31 (circuit N1, R=0.01, X=0.05, 100 MVA on all
> three limits) and verified the branch count went 89 → 90.
>
> N-1 violations dropped from **12 to 10**. The line helps.
>
> The case was **not saved** — this ran in memory. Say the word and I will write it out.
>
> Pages used: `methods/adding-devices-esapp.md`, `methods/reading-violationctg.md`.

Note the last two points. Say plainly that nothing was written to disk, and cite the
pages so a wrong answer is traceable.

### The lesson

The correct call is not guessable. Three reasonable attempts failed identically and
silently.
